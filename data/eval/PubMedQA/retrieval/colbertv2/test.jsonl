{"query": "Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?", "topk": [{"text": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04)."}]}
{"query": "Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?", "topk": [{"text": "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice."}]}

Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival."}]}

{"query": "Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?", "topk": [{"text": "In most cells, the cilium is formed within a compartment separated from the cytoplasm. Entry into the ciliary compartment is regulated by a specialized gate located at the base of the cilium in a region known as the transition zone. The transition zone is closely associated with multiple structures of the ciliary base, including the centriole, axoneme, and ciliary membrane. However, the contribution of these structures to the ciliary gate remains unclear. Here we report that, in Drosophila spermatids, a conserved module of transition zone proteins mutated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), including Cep290, Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2, comprise a ciliary gate that continuously migrates away from the centriole to compartmentalize the growing axoneme tip. We show that Cep290 is essential for transition zone composition, compartmentalization of the axoneme tip, and axoneme integrity and find that MKS proteins also delimit a centriole-independent compartment in mouse spermatids."}]}

Resection of dartos tissue usually makes the penis straight in patients with hypospadias and corrects it in those with buried penis, suggesting a common pathophysiology related to dartos tissue. Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%). Of buried penis cases 78% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0.001). Of hypospadias cases 70% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p < 0.001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II."}]}
{"query": "Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?", "topk": [{"text": "Several risk factors have been claimed to predict the progression of clinically high grade T1 bladder tumors. However, these factors are not specific enough to define which patients should be treated immediately with radical cystectomy. Therefore, it is critical to identify molecular markers that can help provide individualized, risk stratified decision making. Our main goal was to evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression in cases of clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer progression. Total p63, p53 and ΔNp63 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free, disease specific and overall survival. A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed ΔNp63 expression loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to muscle invasive disease. The progression rate was 21.1% in patients with tumors characterized by ΔNp63 loss but no progression was observed in those with tumors with ΔNp63 expression (p <0.001). There was no difference in the number of patients who underwent repeat transurethral resection, had associated carcinoma in situ, showed lymphovascular invasion or received followup intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin courses."}]}

This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.

Here, Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) was applied to quantitatively prioritize drug target(s) within the pathway by identifying its flux-controlling enzymes. The recombinant enzymes were kinetically characterized at physiological pH/temperature. Further, the pathway was in vitro reconstituted using enzyme activity ratios and fluxes similar to those observed in the parasites; then, enzyme and substrate titrations were performed to determine their degree of control on flux. Also, kinetic characterization of the whole pathway was performed. Analyses of the kinetic properties indicated that TXN is the less efficient pathway enzyme derived from its high Kmapp for trypanothione and low Vmax values within the cell. MCA established that the TXN-TXNPx and TXN-GPxA redox pairs controlled by 90-100% the pathway flux, whereas 10% control was attained by TryR. The Kmapp values of the complete pathway for substrates suggested that the pathway flux was determined by the peroxide availability, whereas at high peroxide concentrations, flux may be limited by NADPH."}]}

The effects of VEGFR1/2 kinase inhibitor (VRI) and calycosin on Flt1 tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were evaluated by molecular docking, enzymatic inhibition assay, protein co-immunoprecipitation and siRNA gene knock-down analysis in HUVECs. Toxicities of the chemicals were examined using HUVECs viability. Their effects on angiogenesis and vessel formation were furthered studied in HUVECs in vitro and Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish in vivo. The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. VRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). The impeding effect of calycosin on VRI-induced blood vessel loss was absent in zebrafish embryos injected with Flt1 MO."}]}

In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts.

We studied the relationship between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels and the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia in the acute phase among patients evaluated in the emergency department following transient focal neurological symptoms. Patients evaluated in our academic center for transient neurological symptoms of possible ischemic mechanism were enrolled with informed consent. Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were performed by DiaDexus, Inc. 100 patients were enrolled: 58 were ischemic (30 stroke, 28 TIA), 10 were unknown, and 28 were non-ischemic. Blood samples were collected after a median delay of 23 h (IQR: 17, 36) after symptom onset. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 activity level for ischemic (stroke and TIA) versus non-ischemic events were 186.5 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 153, 216.3) and 169 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 137, 212.5), respectively. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 mass level for ischemic versus non-ischemic events were 202 ng/ml (IQR = 171.6, 226.1) and 192 ng/ml (167.8, 230). The differences in median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels were not statistically significant in the ischemic versus non-ischemic patients. Vessel imaging revealed a symptomatic stenosis in 14 patients (10 intracranial and 4 cervical). The median Lp-PLA2 mass and activity levels among patients with a symptomatic stenosis were not significantly higher than the levels measured in TIA/stroke patients without stenosis."}]}
{"query": "Is osteoprotegerin associated with subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction in diabetic hypertensive patients : a speckle tracking study?", "topk": [{"text": "Recently, the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the pathogenesis of heart failure through different mechanisms has received much attention. Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5."}]}

Whole-genome sequencing was applied to 27 M. abscessus isolates from the 20 patients in this cohort to provide definitive data on the genetic relatedness of strains. Whole-genome sequencing data demonstrated that M. abscessus isolates from 16 patients were unrelated, differing by at least 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from any other isolate, suggesting that independent acquisition events have occurred. Only 2 clusters of very closely related (<25 SNPs) isolates from different patients were seen.

Contemporary treatment options for HO (ie, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and radiation therapy) have adverse effects associated with their use and are not biologically engineered to abrogate the molecular mechanisms that govern osteogenic differentiation. We hypothesized that (1) nanogel-mediated short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery against Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix (Osx) genes will decrease messenger RNA expression; (2) inhibit activity of the osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and (3) inhibit hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition in osteoblast cell cultures. Nanogel nanostructured polymers delivered siRNA in 48-hour treatment cycles against master osteogenic regulators, Runx2 and Osx, in murine calvarial preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1.4) stimulated for osteogenic differentiation by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2). The efficacy of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics was determined by quantitation of messenger RNA knockdown (by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), downstream protein knockdown (determined ALP enzymatic activity assay), and HA deposition (determined by OsteoImage™ assay). Gene expression assays demonstrated that nanogel-based RNAi treatments at 1:1 and 5:1 nanogel:short interfering RNA weight ratios reduced Runx2 expression by 48.59% ± 19.53% (p < 0.001) and 43.22% ± 18.01% (both p < 0.001).

We identified 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) without a history of arthritis, deformity, dysplasia, osteochondral defect, fracture, or surgery about the knee who had MRI of the knee performed. All MR images were ordered by primary care medical physicians for evaluation of nonspecific knee pain. Using a previously described three-dimensional MRI protocol, we measured posterior condylar offset, total condylar height, and articular cartilage thickness at the medial and lateral femoral condyles and compared values to evaluate for potential sex differences. We performed an a priori power calculation using a 2-mm posterior condylar offset difference as the minimum clinically important difference; with 2n = 100, our power to detect such a difference was 99.8%. Compared with females, males had greater medial posterior condylar offset (30 mm [95% CI, 29.3-30.7 mm; SD, 2.5 mm] vs 28 mm [95% CI, 27.0-28.5 mm; SD, 2.7 mm]), lateral posterior condylar offset (27 mm [95% CI, 26.2-27.3 mm; SD, 2.0 mm] vs 25 mm [95% CI, 24.2-25.4 mm; SD, 2.0 mm]), medial condylar height (63 mm [SD, 3.2 mm] vs 57 mm [SD, 4.4 mm]), and lateral condylar height (71 mm [SD, 5.2 mm] vs 65 mm [SD: 4.0 mm]) (all p values < 0.001). However, the mean ratio of medial posterior condylar offset to medial condylar height (0.48 [SD, 0.04] vs 0.49 [SD, 0.05]) and the mean ratio of lateral posterior condylar offset to lateral condylar height (0.38 [SD, 0.05] vs 0.38 [SD, 0.03]) were not different between sexes (p = 0.08 and p = 0.8, respectively). There also was no sex difference in mean articular cartilage thickness at either condyle (medial condyle: 2.7 mm [SD, 0.5 mm] vs 2.5 mm [SD, 0.7 mm]; lateral condyle: 2.6 mm [SD, 0.6 mm] vs 2.5 mm [SD, 0.8 mm]) (both p values ≥ 0.1)."}]}

Few investigators are concerned whether basic physical aspects of mouse housing could be an additional source of stress, capable of influencing the subsequent impact of an experimentally applied stressor. We have recently become aware of the potential for housing conditions to impact important physiological and immunological properties in mice. Here we sought to determine whether housing mice at standard temperature (ST; 22 °C) vs. thermoneutral temperature (TT; 30 °C) influences baseline expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and their typical induction following a whole body heating. There were no significant differences in baseline expression of HSPs at ST and TT. However, in several cases, the induction of Hsp70, Hsp110 and Hsp90 in tissues of mice maintained at ST was greater than at TT following 6 h of heating (which elevated core body temperature to 39.5 °C). This loss of HSP induction was also seen when mice housed at ST were treated with propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, used clinically to treat hypertension and stress."}]}

Because of the avascularity of two-thirds of the meniscal center region, the treatment of tears in this area is hard. Recently, microRNAs have been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases. We focused on microRNA (miR)-210, which plays a wide spectrum of roles comprising mitochondrial metabolism, angiogenesis, DNA repair and cell survival. This study aimed to investigate the effect of intra-articular injection of synthetic miR-210 on the injured meniscus in the avascular zone. The middle segments of the medial meniscus of Spraque Dawley rats were incised longitudinally with a scalpel. An intra-articular injection of double-stranded (ds) miR-210 (for control group using control dsRNA) with atelocollagen was administered immediately after injury. Four weeks and 12 weeks after the injection, we conducted a histologic evaluation, immunohistochemical evaluation and Real-time PCR analysis. In vitro, the inner meniscus and synovial cells were isolated from rat knee joint, and were transfected with ds miR-210 or control dsRNA. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed. Twenty-four hours after the injection, FAM (Fluorescein amidite) labeled miR-210 was observed in the cells around the injured site. Four weeks after the injection, the injured site of the miR-210 group was filled with repaired tissue while that of the control was not repaired. In gene expression analysis of the meniscus, the expression of miR-210, Collagen type 2 alpha 1 (Col2a1), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in the miR-210 group was significantly higher than that in the control. At 12 weeks, the intra-articular injection of miR-210 had healed the injured site of the meniscus and had prevented articular cartilage degeneration. In vitro, miR-210 upregulated Col2a1 expression in the meniscus cells and VEGF and FGF2 expression in the synovial cells."}]}

Here, we have explored PRMT5 expression profiles in dairy goats and its consequences to derivation of iPSCs from dairy goat embryonic fibroblasts (GEFs). We investigated effects of PRMT5 on iPS-like cells production in vitro. alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, QRT-PCR and western blotting analysis of expression of related markers were used to evaluate efficiency of generation of iPSCs derived from GEFs. These showed PRMT5 to be a conservative gene widely expressed in various tissues and different-aged testes. PRMT5 overexpression in combination with OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC (POSKM) significantly increased number of AP positive iPS-like colony-derived GEFs compared to OSKM alone, in our dairy goats. Moreover, our results demonstrated that PRMT5 overexpression stimulated GEF proliferation and down-regulated p53, p21 (a target gene of p53) and the apoptotic marker caspase 3, to enhance somatic cell reprogramming."}]}

Thus, studying mouse models of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency may uncover pathologic developmental processes common among distinct brain disorders. A Syngap1 haploinsufficiency model was used to explore the relationship between critical period dendritic spine abnormalities, cortical circuit assembly, and the window for genetic rescue to understand how damaging mutations disrupt key substrates of mouse brain development. Syngap1 mutations broadly disrupted a developmentally sensitive period that corresponded to the period of heightened postnatal cortical synaptogenesis. Pathogenic Syngap1 mutations caused a coordinated acceleration of dendrite elongation and spine morphogenesis and pruning of these structures in neonatal cortical pyramidal neurons. These mutations also prevented a form of developmental structural plasticity associated with experience-dependent reorganization of brain circuits. Consistent with these findings, Syngap1 mutant mice displayed an altered pattern of long-distance synaptic inputs into a cortical area important for cognition.

{"query": "Does resveratrol enhance palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis in cancer cells?", "topk": [{"text": "Palmitate, a saturated fatty acid (FA), is known to induce toxicity and cell death in various types of cells. Resveratrol (RSV) is able to prevent pathogenesis and/or decelerate the progression of a variety of diseases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown a protective effect of RSV on fat accumulation induced by FAs. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has recently been linked to cellular adipogenic responses. To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines. We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity."}]}

The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2 activity as a prognostic marker in human RCC. Surgical specimens were obtained from 125 patients with RCC without metastasis. Protein expression and kinase activity of CDKs were analyzed using a newly developed assay system named C2P (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We then examined the specific activities (SAs) of CDK1 and CDK2 and calculated CDK2SA-CDK1SA ratio in RCC. Also, risk score (RS) was examined. A total of 125 cases were tested, though 34 cases were excluded because of low sample quality (25 cases) and assay failure (9 cases). In total, 91 cases were analyzed. They included 68 male and 23 female patients, ranging in age from 19 to 83 years. At a median follow-up of 36 months (1-109M), tumor with low CDK2SA-CDK1SA ratio showed significantly better 5-year recurrence-free survival than those with high CDK2SA-CDK1SA ratio (88.7% vs. 54.7%, P = 0.00141). Also, RS enabled the classification of RCCs into high-risk and low-risk groups, and patients with tumors classified as low RS showed better recurrence-free survival than patients with tumors with high RS (88.7% vs. 54.7%, P = 0.0141)."}]}

The degree of horizontal, vertical, and maximum ONH tilt and torsion was compared between NTG and POAG eyes, and additional comparisons were based on the presence of myopia and the location of the visual field defect. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors related to the degree of ONH torsion. Vertical (P = 0.610) and horizontal tilt degree (P = 0.746) did not differ between NTG and POAG eyes. However, torsion degree (P = 0.022) differed significantly between NTG and POAG eyes. Direction of vertical tilt (P = 0.040) and torsion (P < 0.001) showed more prevalent superior tilt and torsion in NTG eyes (21.8% and 33.3%, respectively) compared to POAG eyes (10.3% and 10.3%, respectively). Myopic NTG eyes showed greater torsion degree (P = 0.014) than nonmyopic NTG eyes, which was not observed in the comparison between myopic and nonmyopic POAG eyes. Only NTG eyes showed a significant difference in the degree of maximum tilt (P < 0.001) and torsion (P < 0.001) and the direction of vertical tilt (P < 0.001) and torsion (P = 0.010) by the location of visual field defect.

This study introduces a comprehensive approach to assess this potential for altered population fitness, and uses a combination of demographic data in two habitat types and mathematical (matrix) models that include crop rotations and outcrossing between parental species. Full life-cycle demographic rates, including seed bank survival, of non-GM Brassica rapa × B. napus F1 hybrids and their parent species were estimated from experiments in both agricultural and semi-natural habitats. Altered fitness potential was modelled using periodic matrices including crop rotations and outcrossing between parent species. The demographic vital rates (i.e. for major stage transitions) of the hybrid population were intermediate between or lower than both parental species. The population growth rate (λ) of hybrids indicated decreases in both habitat types, and in a semi-natural habitat hybrids became extinct at two sites. Elasticity analyses indicated that seed bank survival was the greatest contributor to λ. In agricultural habitats, hybrid populations were projected to decline, but with persistence times up to 20 years. The seed bank survival rate was the main driver determining persistence. It was found that λ of the hybrids was largely determined by parental seed bank survival and subsequent replenishment of the hybrid population through outcrossing of B. rapa with B. napus."}]}

Alterations to the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) also cause pancreatitis. However, little is known about the role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced pancreatitis. We measured CFTR activity based on chloride concentrations in sweat from patients with cystic fibrosis, patients admitted to the emergency department because of excessive alcohol consumption, and healthy volunteers. We measured CFTR levels and localization in pancreatic tissues and in patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis induced by alcohol. We studied the effects of ethanol, fatty acids, and fatty acid ethyl esters on secretion of pancreatic fluid and HCO3(-), levels and function of CFTR, and exchange of Cl(-) for HCO3(-) in pancreatic cell lines as well as in tissues from guinea pigs and CFTR knockout mice after administration of alcohol. Chloride concentrations increased in sweat samples from patients who acutely abused alcohol but not in samples from healthy volunteers, indicating that alcohol affects CFTR function. Pancreatic tissues from patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis had lower levels of CFTR than tissues from healthy volunteers. Alcohol and fatty acids inhibited secretion of fluid and HCO3(-), as well as CFTR activity, in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. These effects were mediated by sustained increases in concentrations of intracellular calcium and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, depletion of adenosine triphosphate, and depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. In pancreatic cell lines and pancreatic tissues of mice and guinea pigs, administration of ethanol reduced expression of CFTR messenger RNA, reduced the stability of CFTR at the cell surface, and disrupted folding of CFTR at the endoplasmic reticulum. CFTR knockout mice given ethanol or fatty acids developed more severe pancreatitis than mice not given ethanol or fatty acids."}]}

LTB4 is a pro-inflammatory mediator associated with the etiology and progression of atherosclerosis. It can increase function and number of neutrophils in an autocrine manner. Since hypercholesterolemia is associated with an increase in the number and function of neutrophils, we hypothesized that this effect could be mediated through increased production of LTB4 in neutrophils. Hypercholesterolemia was modeled in Wistar rats by feeding them with a high cholesterol diet. The induction of hypercholesterolemia caused an increase in the plasma levels of LTB4, following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. This effect was recapitulated in vitro, both in the presence and absence of stimulation with the activator of 5-LO, A23187. Neutrophils in hypercholesterolemia rats expressed similar total levels of 5-LO as control rats, but displayed increased nuclear localization of 5-LO, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated 5-LO and ERK1/2. In vitro, MβCD/cholesterol complexes enriched cholesterol in neutrophils, resulted in similar changes in 5-LO/LTB4.

The previous genetic linkage approach by microsatellite haplotyping was continued in new families. A whole genome sequencing was performed to find all possibly pathogenic mutations in the linked area. The detected variations were verified by Sanger sequencing. Six new SMAJ families were identified based on the unique founder haplotype. A critical recombination in 1 family restricted the linked area to 727kb between markers SHGC-106816 and D22S345. In whole genome sequencing a previously unknown mutation c.197G>T p.G66V in CHCHD10 was identified. The mutation was shown to segregate with the disease in 55 patients from 17 families."}]}

In critical patients, under conditions that cause an increase in metabolic state and level of stress, there occurs considerable difference in glucose levels between capillary and venous measurements. This study aimed to investigate the comparability of capillary and venous glucose values, according to the perfusion index level obtained with the Masimo Radical-7(®) device, in critical patients aged 18 years and over. We conducted this prospective and observational study in the emergency department of the Eskisehir Osmangazi University hospital between November 3, 2008 and February 2, 2009. The blood glucose of 300 critical patients was checked by finger stick in the emergency unit. The participants with normal vital signs had perfusion index between 0 and 5; the results obtained by the two methods were more consistent for perfusion index values of 6 and over. The results were most consistent in aged participants with normal vital sign findings and low perfusion index and in young patients with high perfusion index. In the cases where at least one of the vital signs was abnormal, the glucose values obtained by the two methods were more consistent when the perfusion index was 6 or over. In this group, independently from the perfusion index value, the consistency was higher in younger patients compared with aged patients."}]}

This study was designed to explore the potential scientific mechanism(s) that could explain the use of Hordeum vulgare in traditional medicine as a treatment for various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. A crude extract and its three fractions were prepared from HV and screened for the inhibition of platelet aggregation and various metabolites of cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism as well as for its effects on certain antioxidant enzymes. Platelet aggregation was monitored using turbidometric principle, AA metabolism through radioimmunoassay and antioxidant enzymes by commercial kits using spectrophotometer. Results show that HV exhibited activities against all human platelet agonists used except adenine diphosphate, and inhibited both COX and LOX pathways of AA metabolism. It also elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, these activities were distributed in various fractions of HV. Aqueous fraction was most potent in elevating SOD activity; chloroform fraction had concentrated compounds responsible for COX inhibition while n-hexane seems to possess compounds responsible for LOX inhibition as well as the only fraction enhancing the activity of GPx."}]}

In this study, 7-month old P301S tau transgenic mice were subjected to 12-weeks of forced treadmill exercise and evaluated for effects on motor function and tau pathology at 10 months of age. Exercise improved general locomotor and exploratory activity and resulted in significant reductions in full-length and hyperphosphorylated tau in the spinal cord and hippocampus as well as a reduction in sarkosyl-insoluble AT8-tau in the spinal cord. Exercise did not attenuate significant neuron loss in the hippocampus or cortex. Key proteins involved in autophagy-microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 and p62/sequestosome 1 -were also measured to assess whether autophagy is implicated in the exercised-induced reduction of aggregated tau protein.

Here, we searched for PQSs in human retrotransposons and found that PQSs are specifically localized in the 3'-UTR of LINE-1 elements, in LTRs of HERV elements and are strongly accumulated in specific regions of SVA elements. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed that most PQSs had adopted monomolecular or bimolecular guanine quadruplex structures. Evolutionarily young SVA elements contained more PQSs than older elements and their propensity to form quadruplex DNA was higher.

{"query": "Do comparative metabolomics in vegans and omnivores reveal constraints on diet-dependent gut microbiota metabolite production?", "topk": [{"text": "The consumption of an agrarian diet is associated with a reduced risk for many diseases associated with a 'Westernised' lifestyle. Studies suggest that diet affects the gut microbiota, which subsequently influences the metabolome, thereby connecting diet, microbiota and health. However, the degree to which diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota is controversial. Murine models and studies comparing the gut microbiota in humans residing in agrarian versus Western societies suggest that the influence is large. To separate global environmental influences from dietary influences, we characterised the gut microbiota and the host metabolome of individuals consuming an agrarian diet in Western society. Using 16S rRNA-tagged sequencing as well as plasma and urinary metabolomic platforms, we compared measures of dietary intake, gut microbiota composition and the plasma metabolome between healthy human vegans and omnivores, sampled in an urban USA environment. Plasma metabolome of vegans differed markedly from omnivores but the gut microbiota was surprisingly similar. Unlike prior studies of individuals living in agrarian societies, higher consumption of fermentable substrate in vegans was not associated with higher levels of faecal short chain fatty acids, a finding confirmed in a 10-day controlled feeding experiment. Similarly, the proportion of vegans capable of producing equol, a soy-based gut microbiota metabolite, was less than that was reported in Asian societies despite the high consumption of soy-based products."}]}

Temporal changes in cell diameter and the existence of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) were quantified along with changes in cortical actin and chromatin condensation. The cellular viscoelastic mechanical properties were determined by micropipette aspiration. In response to a sudden hypo-osmotic stress, 66% of chondrocytes exhibited an increase in diameter followed by RVD, whilst 25% showed no RVD. By contrast, cells exposed to gradual hypo-osmotic stress exhibited reduced cell swelling without subsequent RVD. There was an increase in the equilibrium modulus for cells exposed to sudden hypo-osmotic stress. However, gradual hypo-osmotic challenge had no effect on cell mechanical properties. This cell stiffening response to sudden hypo-osmotic challenge was abolished when actin organization was disrupted with cytochalasin D or RVD inhibited with REV5901.

Liver tissues were collected from ALR-L-KO mice and ALR(floxed/floxed) mice (controls) and analyzed by histology, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and techniques to measure fibrosis and lipids. Liver tissues from patients with and without advanced liver disease were determined by immunoblot analysis. Two weeks after birth, livers of ALR-L-KO mice contained low levels of ALR and adenosine triphosphate (ATP); they had reduced mitochondrial respiratory function and increased oxidative stress, compared with livers from control mice, and had excessive steatosis, and hepatocyte apoptosis. Levels of carbamyl-palmitoyl transferase 1a and ATP synthase subunit ATP5G1 were reduced in livers of ALR-L-KO mice, indicating defects in mitochondrial fatty acid transport and ATP synthesis. Electron microscopy showed mitochondrial swelling with abnormalities in shapes and numbers of cristae. From weeks 2-4 after birth, levels of steatosis and apoptosis decreased in ALR-L-KO mice, and numbers of ALR-expressing cells increased, along with ATP levels. However, at weeks 4-8 after birth, livers became inflamed, with hepatocellular necrosis, ductular proliferation, and fibrosis; hepatocellular carcinoma developed by 1 year after birth in nearly 60% of the mice.

In this study, our aim was to investigate the pathogenesis of PPI-REE by using a recently described EoE diagnostic panel (EDP) composed of a set of 94 esophageal transcripts and to determine whether PPI therapy reverses any esophageal transcriptional abnormalities. We evaluated the EDP signature in biopsy samples obtained from adult and pediatric patients with PPI-REE from 4 institutions and compared the pre- and post-PPI therapy expression profiles of these subjects with those of patients with active EoE. The EDP differentiated patients with EoE from control subjects with 100% accuracy among the 4 clinical sites. Bioinformatics analysis revealed largely overlapping transcriptomes between patients with PPI-REE and those with EoE, including the genes for eosinophil chemotaxis (eotaxin 3, CCL26), barrier molecules (desmoglein 1, DSG1), tissue remodeling (periostin, POSTN), and mast cells (carboxypeptidase A, CPA3). PPI monotherapy alone almost completely reversed the allergic inflammatory transcriptome of patients with PPI-REE.

Rotenone increased lysosomal membrane permeability as evidenced by leakage of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and cathepsin D, the effects were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron. Autophagy inducer trehalose enhanced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, accelerated the clearance of autophagosomes and α-synuclein and attenuated rotenone-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of trehalose to rats in drinking water (2%) decreased rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons loss in SNpc."}]}

Obesity and central fat distribution are considered to have been associated with severe AP. This study investigated the profile of inflammatory cytokines in AP to determine how they are related to obesity, central fat distribution, and AP severity. Fifty-nine patients with AP were prospectively enrolled in the study. Body mass index and waist circumference were obtained at admission. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL-Iβ, IL-1ra, IL-6, TNF-α, sTNFR-I, and sTNFR-II, were measured on day 1 and 2 of AP. Of the patients included in the study, 19 (32%) were overweight, 23 (39%) had central fat distribution, and 23 (39%) had moderate AP. IL-1ra and IL-6 were significantly higher in overweight patients compared with non-overweight patients. IL-1ra, IL-6, TNF-α, and sTNFR-I were significantly higher in patients with central fat distribution compared with patients with non-central fat distribution. IL-6, sTNFR-I, and sTNFR-II were significantly higher in patients with moderate pancreatitis compared to those with mild pancreatitis. Among the six cytokines, IL-6 was commonly elevated in patients with central fat distribution, overweight, and moderate AP.

{"query": "Does diet-induced obesity prevent the development of acute traumatic coagulopathy?", "topk": [{"text": "Obesity and hemorrhagic shock following trauma are predictors of mortality but have conflicting effects on coagulation. Following hemorrhage, tissue injury and hypoperfusion lead to acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), producing a hypocoagulable state. Inversely, obesity promotes clotting and impairs fibrinolysis to yield a hypercoagulable state. High rates of venous thromboembolism, organ failure, and early mortality may be caused by hypercoagulability in obese patients. We hypothesize that obesity prevents the development of ATC following injury-induced hemorrhagic shock. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g) were fed a high-fat diet (32%kcal from fat) for 4 weeks to 6 weeks and diverged into obesity-resistant (OR, n = 9) and obesity-prone (OP, n = 9) groups. Age-matched control (CON) rats were fed normal diet (10% kcal from fat, n = 9). Anesthetized rats were subjected to an uncontrolled hemorrhage by a Grade V splenic injury to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg. Hypotension (MAP, 30-40 mm Hg) was maintained for 30 minutes to induce shock. MAP, heart rate, lactate, base excess, cytokines, blood loss, and thrombelastography (TEG) parameters were measured before and after hemorrhagic shock. At baseline, OP rats exhibited a shorter time to 20-mm clot (K), and higher rate of clot formation (α angle), clot strength (maximal amplitude), and coagulation index, compared with the CON rats (p < 0.05), indicating enhanced coagulation. Physiologic parameters following shock were similar between groups. In the CON and OR rats, shock prolonged the time to clot initiation (R) and K and decreased α angle and coagulation index (all p < 0.05 vs. baseline). In contrast, shock had no effect on these TEG parameters in the OP rats. Maximal amplitude was the only TEG parameter affected by shock in the OP rats, which was decreased in all groups."}]}

Of 250 patients experiencing BF post-SRT, 172 had a calculable prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) prior to SADT initiation. These patients comprise the analyzed cohort and were divided into four groups based on characteristics at SADT initiation: those with PSADTs >3 months without distant metastasis (DM) (group 1 [less advanced disease], n=62), those with PSADTs <3 months without DM (group 2 [more advanced disease], n=28), those with DM (group 3 [more advanced disease], n=32), and those not receiving SADT during follow-up (group 4, n=50). Endpoints included prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analysis. Median follow-up post-SRT was 7.9 years.

A re-analysis was undertaken of the changes in the multi-decadal study, which concerned forest understorey communities on infertile (serpentine) and fertile soils in an aridifying climate (southern Oregan) from 1949-1951 to 2007-2008. Macroclimatic variables, overstorey cover and soil texture were used as new covariates. As an alternative measure of climate-related change, the community mean value of specific leaf area was used, a functional trait measuring drought tolerance. We investigated whether these revised analyses supported the prediction of lesser sensitivity to climate change in understorey communities on infertile serpentine soils. Overstorey cover, but not macroclimate or soil texture, was a significant covariate of community change over time. It strongly buffered understorey temperatures, was correlated with less change and averaged >50 % lower on serpentine soils, thereby counteracting the lower climate sensitivity of understorey herbs on these soils. Community mean specific leaf area showed the predicted pattern of less change over time in serpentine than non-serpentine communities."}]}

For instance, a peptide/CpG-based cancer vaccine has been evaluated in several clinical trials and was shown in pre-clinical studies to favor the expansion of effector T versus Tregs cells, resulting in a potent antitumor activity, as compared to other TLR ligands. Alternatively, the adjuvant activity of CD1d-restricted invariant NKT cells (iNKT) on the innate and adaptive immunity is well demonstrated, and several CD1d glycolipid ligands are under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. Importantly, additive or even synergistic effects have been shown upon combined CD1d/NKT agonists and TLR ligands. The aim of the present study is to combine the activation and tumor targeting of activated iNKT, NK and T cells. Activation and tumor targeting of iNKT cells via recombinant α-galactosylceramide (αGC)-loaded CD1d-anti-HER2 fusion protein (CD1d-antitumor) is combined or not with OVA peptide/CpG vaccine. Circulating and intratumoral NK and H-2Kb/OVA-specific CD8 responses are monitored, as well as the state of activation of dendritic cells (DC) with regard to activation markers and IL-12 secretion. The resulting antitumor therapy is tested against established tumor grafts of B16 melanoma cells expressing human HER2 and ovalbumin. The combined CD1d/iNKT antitumor therapy and CpG/peptide-based immunization leads to optimized expansion of NK and OVA-specific CD8 T cells (CTLs), likely resulting from the maturation of highly pro-inflammatory DCs as seen by a synergistic increase in serum IL-12. The enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses result in higher tumor inhibition that correlates with increased numbers of OVA-specific CTLs at the tumor site. Antibody-mediated depletion experiments further demonstrate that in this context, CTLs rather than NK cells are essential for the enhanced tumor inhibition."}]}

However, the prognostic value remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether expression of PTN has prognostic relevance in human gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression of PTN proteins in 178 patients with gastric cancer. The level of PTN mRNA in gastric cancer tissues and paratumor tissues were evaluated in 52 paired cases by quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction(qRT-PCR). Survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method was performed to assess prognostic significance. The expression level of PTN in gastric cancer tissues was significantly higher (P<0.001) than those in paratumor tissues according to the immunohistochemistry analysis, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Additionally, the overexpression of PTN was significantly associated with the tumor site (P=0.001), Lauren’s classification (P<0.001),histologic differentiation(P=0.014),depth of invasion(P<0.001), TNM stage (P=0.003),and lymph node metastasis (P=0.002). Moreover, the Cox proportional- hazards regression analysis revealed that the increased expression of PTN was an independent prognostic factor for poor recurrence-free survival(RFS) and overall survival(OS)(both P<0.001)."}]}

The CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc has been shown in tissue culture to be able to repel cell-free virions from the cell surface into extracellular space. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc might exhibit a similar effect, and tested this using clinical samples from the Phase IIb study 652-2-202, by measuring rates of intracellular DNA decline. We also monitored viral RNA levels in culture fluids. We infected PM-1 cells with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 BaL in the presence or absence of inhibitory concentrations of cenicriviroc (20 nM) or maraviroc (50 nM) or controls. Viral load levels and p24 were measured by ELISA, quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR at 4 h post-infection. Frozen PBMC DNA samples from 30 patients with virological success in the Phase IIb study were studied, as were early and late reverse transcript levels. Docking studies compared binding between cenicriviroc/CCR5 and maraviroc/CCR5. Unlike maraviroc, cenicriviroc did not cause an increase in the amount of virus present in culture fluids at 4 h compared with baseline. The use of cenicriviroc did, however, result in lower levels of intracellular viral DNA after 4 h. Structural modelling indicates that cenicriviroc binds more deeply than maraviroc to the hydrophobic pocket of CCR5, providing an explanation for the absence of viral rebound with cenicriviroc."}]}

Previously, we have reported that the expression of NAIF1 protein is down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. However, the role of NAIF1 in gastric cancer cells is not fully understood. The effects of NAIF1 on cell viability were evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. The ability of cellular migration and invasion were analyzed by transwell assays. The expression levels of targeted proteins were determined by western blot. The relative RNA expression levels were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Xenograft experiment was employed to determine the anti-tumor ability of NAIF1 in vivo. The study demonstrates that transient transfection of NAIF1 in gastric cancer cells BGC823 and MKN45 could inhibit the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of the two gastric cancer cell lines. The tumor size is smaller in NAIF1-overexpressed MKN45 cell xenograft mice than in unexpressed group. Further in-depth analysis reveals that NAIF1 reduces the expression of MMP2 as well as MMP9, and inhibits the activation of FAK, all of which are key molecules involved in regulating cell migration and invasion. In addition, NAIF1 inhibits the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by accelerating its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Meanwhile, NAIF1 reduces the mRNA and protein expression of ERK1/2."}]}

We developed a CMV specific IGRA comparing synthetic CMV peptides, native lysate and recombinant antigen. In addition, TLR agonists were tested to enhance CMV antigen immunogenicity. 397 healthy controls (HC) were stratified according to CMV IgM and IgG serostatus and subsequently tested for IFNγ- and IL2-secretion in whole blood after challenge with synthetic, native or recombinant CMV antigens and TLR agonists by ELISA. The selected TLR agonists were lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN), zymosan (Zym), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), flagellin (Fla), R848, loxoribine (Lox) and bropirimine (Bro). Synthetic pp65 peptides elicited strong IFNγ responses in CMV seropositive, but not seronegative HC (6418 vs. 13 pg/ml). Native lysates and recombinant pp65 induced equally high IFNγ responses in seropositive (35,877 and 26,428 pg/ml) and increased background IFNγ expression in seronegative HC (43 and 1148 pg/ml). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with regard to anti-CMV serology reached 100% for synthetic pp65 and native CMV lysate, but 57% and 100% for recombinant pp65, respectively.

Genomic prediction accuracies using 1748 trees and 6932 SNPs representative of as many distinct gene loci were determined for growth and wood traits in white spruce, within and between environments and breeding groups (BG), each with an effective size of Ne ≈ 20. Marker subsets were also tested. Model fits and/or cross-validation (CV) prediction accuracies for ridge regression (RR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models approached those of pedigree-based models. With strong relatedness between CV sets, prediction accuracies for RR within environment and BG were high for wood (r = 0.71-0.79) and moderately high for growth (r = 0.52-0.69) traits, in line with trends in heritabilities. For both classes of traits, these accuracies achieved between 83% and 92% of those obtained with phenotypes and pedigree information. Prediction into untested environments remained moderately high for wood (r ≥ 0.61) but dropped significantly for growth (r ≥ 0.24) traits, emphasizing the need to phenotype in all test environments and model genotype-by-environment interactions for growth traits. Removing relatedness between CV sets sharply decreased prediction accuracies for all traits and subpopulations, falling near zero between BGs with no known shared ancestry. For marker subsets, similar patterns were observed but with lower prediction accuracies."}]}

{"query": "Does microRNA-19a enhance proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells by targeting TGFβR2 gene in severe asthma?", "topk": [{"text": "Allergic asthma is characterized by inflammation and airway remodeling. Bronchial epithelium is considered a key player in coordinating airway wall remodeling. In mild asthma, the epithelium is damaged and fails to proliferate and to repair, whereas in severe asthma, the epithelium is highly proliferative and thicker. This may be due to different regulatory mechanisms. The purpose of our study was to determine the role of miRNAs in regulating proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells obtained from severe asthmatic subjects in comparison with cells obtained from mild asthmatics and healthy controls. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) were isolated by bronchoscopy from bronchial biopsies of healthy donors and patients with mild and severe asthma. MiRNA expression was evaluated using the TaqMan low-density arrays and qRT-PCR. Transfection studies of bronchial epithelial cells were performed to determine the target genes. Cell proliferation was evaluated by BrdU incorporation test. MiR-19a was upregulated in epithelia of severe asthmatic subjects compared with cells from mild asthmatics and healthy controls. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter and Western blot assays suggest that miR-19a enhances cell proliferation of BEC in severe asthma through targeting TGF-β receptor 2 mRNA. Moreover, repressed expression of miR-19a increased SMAD3 phosphorylation through TGF-β receptor 2 signaling and abrogated BEC proliferation."}]}

The objective of this article is to determine the influence of sexual activity on the intraesophageal acid exposure and acid reflux events in GERD patients. Twenty-one patients with the diagnosis of GERD were prospectively enrolled. Intraesophageal pH monitoring was recorded for 48 hours with a Bravo capsule. All patients were instructed to have sexual intercourse or abstain in a random order two hours after the same refluxogenic dinner within two consecutive nights. Patients were requested to have sex in the standard \"missionary position\" and women were warned to avoid abdominal compression. The patients completed a diary reporting the time of the sexual intercourse and GERD symptoms. The percentage of reflux time and acid reflux events were compared in two ways: within 30 and 60 minutes prior to and after sexual intercourse on the day of sexual intercourse and in the same time frame of the day without sexual intercourse. Fifteen of 21 GERD patients were analyzed. The percentage of reflux time and number of acid reflux events did not show a significant difference within the 30- and 60-minute periods prior to and after sexual intercourse on the day of sexual intercourse and on the day without sexual intercourse, as well."}]}
{"query": "Is vascular injury associated with increased mortality in winter sports trauma?", "topk": [{"text": "Trauma is the leading cause of injury and death for individuals aged 1-44 years. Up to 8% of the US population participates in winter sports, and although vascular injuries are uncommon in these activities, little is published in this area.

Patients with winter sports trauma and the subset with vascular injuries were identified by accessing the National Trauma Data Bank querying years 2007-2010. Patients with and without vascular injuries were then compared. Admission variables included transport time, emergency department hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90), Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8, Injury Severity Score ≥ 25, fractures, solid organ injury, and vascular injury. Outcomes were analyzed and associations with vascular injuries were determined. A total of 2,298 patients were identified with winter sports-related trauma and 28 (1.2%) had associated vascular injuries. Overall, the top 3 injuries were head trauma (16.7%), thoracic vertebral fractures (5.5%), and lumbar vertebral fractures (5.1%). The most common associated vascular injures were to the popliteal artery (17.7%), splenic artery (14.7%), and brachial blood vessels (14.7%). In the entire cohort, 1 patient (0.04%) suffered an amputation and 15 patients (0.7%) died. There were no amputations in the vascular injury group.

We sought to identify in adults the genetic determinants of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and to assess whether environmental and disease-related factors influence these associations. We performed a genome-wide association study of FeNO through meta-analysis of two independent discovery samples of European ancestry: the outbred EGEA study (French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma, N = 610 adults) and the Hutterites (N = 601 adults), a founder population living on communal farms. Replication of main findings was assessed in adults from an isolated village in Sardinia (Talana study, N = 450). We then investigated the influence of asthma, atopy and tobacco smoke exposure on these genetic associations, and whether they were also associated with FeNO values in children of the EAGLE (EArly Genetics & Lifecourse Epidemiology, N = 8858) consortium. We detected a common variant in RAB27A (rs2444043) associated with FeNO that reached the genome-wide significant level (P = 1.6 × 10(-7) ) in the combined discovery and replication adult data sets. This SNP belongs to member of RAS oncogene family (RAB27A) and was associated with an expression quantitative trait locus for RAB27A in lymphoblastoid cell lines from asthmatics. A second suggestive locus (rs2194437, P = 8.9 × 10(-7) ) located nearby the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (SLC8A1) was mainly detected in atopic subjects and influenced by inhaled corticosteroid use.

Specifically, disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation have been reported in maltreated children. The current study investigates whether increased cortisol variability is responsible for inconsistent patterns in the literature. This study modeled cortisol activity over 20 weeks in 187 maltreated and 154 nonmaltreated children (mean = 8.4 years, SD = 1.8 years) in order to capture week-to-week cortisol patterns. Maltreatment was assessed through coding of Department of Human Services records. Children attended an after-school program 1 day per week for 20 weeks, where saliva was collected at the same time each day and subsequently assayed for cortisol. Multiple-group growth curves indicated that maltreated and non-maltreated children differ in longitudinal cortisol patterns. Maltreated children showed higher variance in the initial cortisol levels and slope over time compared to nonmaltreated children, indicating greater between-person variability in the maltreated group. Maltreated children with higher cortisol at the first assessment showed cortisol suppression over time, indicating potential HPA blunting after chronic high cortisol levels. The severity, timing, and number of subtypes of maltreatment predicted individuals' cortisol variability, and both maltreatment status and greater cortisol variability predicted more behavior problems."}]}

Although transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) facilitates invasion of various types of cancer cells, the role of the TGF-β pathway in CSCC is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the role of TGF-β signaling in the progression of CSCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of TGF-β pathway molecules in 67 CSCC samples with clinicopathological data. Activation of the TGF-β pathway was investigated following co-culture of CSCC cells and cervical cancer-associated fibroblasts (CCAFs). Clinicopathological analysis of CSCC samples revealed that prominent expression of TGF-β receptor-2 was more frequent in CSCC with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) than without LVSI (p < 0.01). Lymph node metastasis was more frequent in cases in which phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3) was localized exclusively at the boundary of tumor clusters (n = 9, p < 0.05). Recombinant TGF-β1 increased pSMAD3 expression and enhanced cellular invasion (p < 0.005) in CSCC cells, which was attenuated by an inhibitor of the TGF-β receptor (p < 0.005). Enhanced pSMAD3 expression and invasion was also observed when conditioned media from CSCC cells co-cultured with CCAFs were administered. Luciferase assays showed that this medium contained a large amount of active TGF-β. Along with TGF-β activation, thrombospondin-1 was upregulated in both CSCC cells and CCAFs, while thrombospondin-1 silencing in either CSCC cells or CCAFs repressed the activity of TGF-β. Thrombospondin-1 was prominently expressed in cases with pSMAD3 boundary staining (p < 0.05)."}]}

In the present study, the authors report the mechanism by which CQ enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ to aid future studies aimed at improving this therapeutic regimen. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, the authors determined the mechanism by which CQ enhances TMZ cytotoxicity. They focused on the inhibition-of-autophagy mechanism of CQ by knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins or treatment with autophagy inhibitors. This mechanism was tested using an in vivo model with subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors from mice treated with CQ in combination with TMZ. Knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins (GRP78 and Beclin) or treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), blocked autophagosome formation and reduced CQ cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagosome accumulation precedes CQ-induced cell death. In contrast, blocking autophagosome formation with knockdown of GRP78 or treatment with 3-MA enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity, suggesting that the autophagy pathway protects from TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. CQ in combination with TMZ significantly increased the amounts of LC3B-II (a marker for autophagosome levels), CHOP/GADD-153, and cleaved PARP (a marker for apoptosis) over those with untreated or individual drug-treated glioma cells. These molecular mechanisms seemed to take place in vivo as well.

A retrospective analysis was conducted of 37 patients who underwent operations for glioblastoma between 2004 and 2012. Volumetric analysis of postoperative Gd-enhanced MR images, obtained within 48 hours, confirmed tumor gross-total resection (GTR) in all but 2 patients. All patients received the first cycle of TMZ at a dosage of 150 mg/m(2) starting on the second or third postsurgical day. Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. With regard to adjuvant TMZ therapy, the 19 patients in Group A, aged 30-72 years (mean 56.1 years), received 150 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 28 days for more than 6 cycles (range 7-101 cycles). The 18 patients in Group B, aged 46-82 years (mean 64.8 years), received the same dose, but for no more than 6 cycles. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status was analyzed for both groups and correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The impact of age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and Ki 67 staining were also considered. All patients but 1 in Group A survived at least 18 months (range 18-101 months), and patients in Group B survived no more than 17 months (range 2-17 months). The long-term survivors (Group A), defined as patients who survived at least 12 months after diagnosis, were 51.3% of the total (19/37). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients treated with more than 6 TMZ cycles had OS and PFS that was significantly longer than patients receiving standard treatment (median OS 28 months vs 8 months, respectively; p = 0.0001; median PFS 20 months vs 4 months, respectively; p = 0.0002). By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, MGMT methylation status and number of TMZ cycles appeared to be survival prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma. After controlling for MGMT status, highly significant differences related to OS and PFS between patients with standard and long-term TMZ treatment were still detected. Furthermore, in Group A and B, the statistical correlation of MGMT status to the number of TMZ cycles showed a significant difference only in Group A patients, suggesting that MGMT promoter methylation was predictive of response for long-term TMZ treatment. Prolonged therapy did not confer hematological toxicity or opportunistic infections in either patient group."}]}

Plaque forming assay and immunoblotting studies were used to determine virus production and viral protein expression, respectively. Myriocin showed no cytotoxic effect at up to 5 μM. Myriocin treatment did not inhibit HSV-2 infection. Instead, the treatment resulted in accelerated replication of HSV-2 and increased titers of infectious virion. The effect was detected at concentrations as low as 3 nM and plateaued at approximately 30 nM. Myriocin at 30 nM increased HSV-2 production by approximately 1.7 logs. Myriocin also promoted HSV-1 infection but required higher concentrations. A time course study revealed that myriocin promoted HSV-2 infection by acceleration of virus replication.

{"query": "Does prenatal zinc reduce stress response in adult rat offspring exposed to lipopolysaccharide during gestation?", "topk": [{"text": "Previous investigations by our group have shown that prenatal treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg, intraperitoneally) on gestation day (GD) 9.5 in rats, which mimics infections by Gram-negative bacteria, induces short- and long-term behavioral and neuroimmune changes in the offspring. Because LPS induces hypozincemia, dams were treated with zinc after LPS in an attempt to prevent or ameliorate the impairments induced by prenatal LPS exposure. LPS can also interfere with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis development; thus, behavioral and neuroendocrine parameters linked to HPA axis were evaluated in adult offspring after a restraint stress session. We prenatally exposed Wistar rats to LPS (100 μg/kg, intraperitoneally, on GD 9.5). One hour later they received zinc (ZnSO4, 2 mg/kg, subcutaneously). Adult female offspring that were in metestrus/diestrus were submitted to a 2 h restraint stress session. Immediately after the stressor, 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, open field behavior, serum corticosterone and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and striatal and hypothalamic neurotransmitter and metabolite levels were assessed. Offspring that received prenatal zinc after LPS presented longer periods in silence, increased locomotion, and reduced serum corticosterone and striatal norepinephrine turnover compared with rats treated with LPS and saline. Prenatal zinc reduced acute restraint stress response in adult rats prenatally exposed to LPS."}]}
{"query": "Are global histone H3 lysine 27 triple methylation levels reduced in vessels with advanced atherosclerotic plaques?", "topk": [{"text": "Alterations in epigenetic processes are frequently noted in human disease. These epigenetic processes involve methylation of DNA and post-translational modifications of histones. It is well established that in particular histone methylation plays a key role in gene transcription. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between triple methylation of lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27Me3) modifications and atherosclerotic plaque stage. 28 peri-renal aortic tissue patches covering the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic plaque development were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the levels of H3K27Me3, EZH2, JMJD3 and BMI1. The results of our studies are in support of a reduction in global levels of the H3K27Me3 modification in vessels with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. This reduction in H3K27Me3 levels is not accompanied by alterations in global levels of the corresponding histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Likewise no alterations in global levels of BMI1, a component of the PRC1 complex, which binds to H3K27Me3-modified histones or the global expression levels of the histone demethylase JMJD3, which removes the methyl marks on H3K27, were observed."}]}
{"query": "Does corn silk maysin induce apoptotic cell death in PC-3 prostate cancer cells via mitochondria-dependent pathway?", "topk": [{"text": "Despite recent advances in prostate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, the overall survival rate still remains low. This study was aimed to assess potential anti-cancer activity of maysin, a major flavonoid of corn silk (CS, Zea mays L.), in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3). Maysin was isolated from CS of Kwangpyeongok, a Korean hybrid corn, via methanol extraction and preparative C18 reverse phase column chromatography. Maysin cytotoxicity was determined by either monitoring cell viability in various cancer cell lines by MTT assay or morphological changes. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), expression levels of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 and by terminal transferase mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Underlying mechanism in maysin-induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells was explored by evaluating its effects on Akt and ERK pathway. Maysin dose-dependently reduced the PC-3 cell viability, with an 87% reduction at 200 μg/ml. Maysin treatment significantly induced apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation, depolarization of MMP, and reduction in Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 expression levels. Maysin also significantly attenuated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK. A combined treatment with maysin and other known anti-cancer agents, including 5-FU, etoposide, cisplatin, or camptothecin, synergistically enhanced PC-3 cell death."}]}

A broth serial microdilution method with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antioxidant activity was determined using free-radical-scavenging assays, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. Four extracts and five fractions had good to weak antimicrobial activity with MICs ranging from 0.04 to >1.25 mg/ml against both fungi and bacteria. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions had an MIC of 0.08 mg/ml against Aspergillus fumigatus. The n-butanol fraction had an MIC of 0.04 mg/ml against Cryptococcus neoformans. The hexane and chloroform fractions had an MIC of 0.08 mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus. The antioxidant activities were much lower than that of the positive controls. Except for the alkaloid extract, all the extracts and fractions had free-radical-scavenging activity (IC50 ranging from 33.66 to 314.30 μg/ml).

Rodent models have played a critical role in establishing causal relationships and identifying mechanisms of altered brain and behavior development in pups prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA). We recently developed a novel nonhuman primate model to bridge the gap between human epidemiological studies and rodent models of prenatal immune challenge. Our initial results demonstrated that rhesus monkeys given the viral mimic synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-l-lysine) during pregnancy produce offspring with abnormal repetitive behaviors, altered communication, and atypical social interactions. We utilized noninvasive infrared eye tracking to further evaluate social processing capabilities in a subset of the first trimester MIA-exposed offspring (n = 4) and control animals (n = 4) from our previous study. As juveniles, the MIA offspring differed from control animals on several measures of social attention, particularly when viewing macaque faces depicting the fear grimace facial expression. Compared with control animals, MIA offspring had a longer latency before fixating on the eyes, had fewer fixations directed at the eyes, and spent less total time fixating on the eyes of the fear grimace images."}]}
{"query": "Does atractylodes macrocephala Koidz stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration through a polyamine dependent mechanism?", "topk": [{"text": "Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AMK), a valuable traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in clinical practice for treating patients with disorders of the digestive system. AMK has shown noteworthy promoting effect on improving gastrointestinal function and immunity, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of intestinal mucosa injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of AMK on intestinal mucosal restitution and the underlying mechanisms via intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell migration model. A cell migration model of IEC-6 cells was induced by a single-edge razor blade along the diameter of the cell layers in six-well polystyrene plates. After wounding, the cells were grown in control cultures and in cultures containing spermidine (5μM, SPD, reference drug), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2.5mM, DFMO, polyamine inhibitor), AMK (50, 100, and 200mg/L), DFMO plus SPD and DFMO plus AMK for 12h. The polyamines content was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pre-column derivatization. The Rho mRNAs expression levels were assessed by Q-RT-PCR. The Rho and non-muscle myosin II proteins expression levels were analyzed by Western blot. The formation and distribution of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers were monitored with immunostaining techniques using specific antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy. Cell migration assay was carried out using inverted microscope and the Image-Pro Plus software. All of these indexes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of AMK. (1) Treatment with AMK caused significant increases in cellular polyamines content and Rho mRNAs and proteins expression levels, as compared to control group. Furthermore, AMK exposure increased non-muscle myosin II protein expression levels and formation of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers, and resulted in an acceleration of cell migration in IEC-6 cells. (2) Depletion of cellular polyamines by DFMO resulted in a decrease of cellular polyamines levels, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, thereby inhibiting IEC-6 cell migration. AMK not only reversed the inhibitory effects of DFMO on the polyamines content, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, but also restored cell migration to control levels."}]}

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Accumulating evidence shows that the elevated vascular tone in hypertension is a consequence of the 'ion channel remodelling' that occurs during sustained high BP. The present study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise on the electrical remodelling of L-type Ca(2+) (Cav 1.2) and large-conductance Ca(2+) -activated K(+) (KCa 1.1) channels in mesenteric arteries (MAs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). SHRs and normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) rats were subjected to aerobic training or kept sedentary, and vascular mechanical and functional properties were evaluated. Exercise did not affect the heart weight, but reduced the heart rate and body weight in SHR. In mesenteric arterial myocytes, exercise normalized the increased Cav 1.2 and KCa 1.1 current density in SHRs. Exercise also ameliorated the increased open probability and mean open time of the single KCa 1.1 channel in hypertension. The isometric contraction study revealed that both nifedipine (Cav 1.2 channel blocker) and NS11021 (KCa 1.1 channel activator) induced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in MAs precontracted with noradrenaline. Exercise normalized the increased sensitivity of tissues to nifedipine and NS11021 in SHR. Furthermore, protein expression of the Cav 1.2 α1C -subunit together with the KCa 1.1 α- and β1-subunit was significantly increased in SHRs; and exercise ameliorated these molecular alterations in hypertension."}]}

Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5. Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation. Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and Tyr-271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , Ile-279(6.59) and Tyr-308(7.43) were well tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for that of TAK-779."}]}

The ipl injection of formalin was used to assess the nociceptive activity. Moreover, by pretreating mice with non-selective and selective antagonists of adenosine receptors, the effects of icv NPS on formalin-induced ongoing nociception were assessed. Morphine-induced antinociceptive effects were observed during phases 1 and 2 of the test, while indomethacin was active only at the later nociceptive phase. The ipl injection of NPS (alone or combined with formalin) did not modify the nociceptive response. However, icv NPS significantly reduced formalin-induced nociception during both phases. Caffeine (3 mg/kg, ip), a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, prevented NPS-induced antinociceptive effects. Similar to caffeine, icv ZM241385 (0.01 nmol), an A2A receptor antagonist, prevented the antinociceptive effects of NPS.

The functional neuroanatomy of aversive anticipation was probed through functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n = 99 and n = 69), and we studied the influence of genetic variance in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Skin conductance and startle data served as objective psychophysiological indices of the intensity of individuals' anticipatory responses to potential threat. Threat cues signaling risk of future electrical shock activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and midbrain consistently across both samples. Threat-related dmPFC activation was enhanced in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers in sample 1 and this effect was validated in sample 2.

The expression of α-enolase was detected in rat hearts and primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes with or without Dox administration. An adenovirus carrying short-hairpin interfering RNA targeting α-enolase was constructed and transduced specifically into the heart by intramyocardial injection. Heart function, cell apoptosis and mitochondrial function were measured following Dox administration. In addition, by using gain- and loss-of-function approaches to regulate α-enolase expression in primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes, we investigated the role of endogenous, wide type and catalytically inactive mutant α-enolase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ATP generation. Furthermore, the involvement of α-enolase in AMPK phosphorylation was also studied. The mRNA and protein expression of cardiac α-enolase was significantly upregulated by Dox. Genetic silencing of α-enolase in rat hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes attenuated Dox-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, overexpression of wide-type or catalytically inactive α-enolase in cardiomyocytes mimicked the detrimental role of Dox in inducing apoptosis and ATP reduction. AMPK dephosphorylation was further demonstrated to be involved in the proapoptotic and ATP-depriving effects of α-enolase."}]}

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 33 women admitted to two major burns units, their families, and 26 key informant doctors, nurses, and police officers. We used framework analysis to examine the context in which burns occurred and the sequence of medicolegal action after admission to hospital. Interviewees described accidents, attempted suicide, and attempted homicide. Distinguishing between these was difficult because the underlying combination of poverty and cultural precedent was common to all and action was contingent on potentially conflicting narratives. Space constraint, problems with cooking equipment, and inflammable clothing increased the risk of accidental burns, but coexisted with household conflict, gender-based violence, and alcohol use. Most burns were initially ascribed to accidents. Clinicians adhered to medicolegal procedures, the police carried out their investigative requirements relatively rapidly, but both groups felt vulnerable in the face of the legal process. Women's understandable reticence to describe burns as non-accidental, the contested nature of statements, their perceived history of changeability, the limited quality and validity of forensic evidence, and the requirement for resilience on the part of clients underlay a general pessimism."}]}

This study investigated the relationship between length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital after surgery and different psychosocial variables (e.g. depression, anxiety, self rated health, happiness, satisfaction). We enrolled prospective patients who were waiting for elective cardiac surgery (N = 267) and consented to take part in the study. We collected data of sociodemographic, medical and perioperative factors as well as psychosocial questionnaires completed 1.56 days (standard deviation [SD] = 0.7) before surgery. The primary clinical endpoint was an ICU stay of at least 3 days and the secondary was hospital stay of at least 10 days. Two hundred sixty-seven patients participated in this study. Four patients (1.5%) died in the hospital and 38 patients (14.5%) spent more than 3 days in the ICU and 62 patients (23.2%) spent more than 10 days in the hospital.

This manuscript describes the effect of photon and carbon-ion IR on WHO class I meningioma cell migration and provides an approach to the underlying cellular mechanisms. Meningioma cells were gained operatively at the university hospital in Homburg/Saar, Germany. For migration, membranes (8-µm pore sizes) were coated with collagen I, with collagen IV, and with fibronectin. Cells were analyzed in migration experiments with or without serum stimulation, with or without photon and carbon IR 24 h prior to experiments, and with or without integrin antibodies. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of the integrins ανβ1, ανβ3, and ανβ5 were performed without IR and 6, 12 and 24 h after IR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were realized with and without IR after cells were cultured on collagen I, collagen IV, or fibronectin for 24 h. Cells and supernatants for FACS and ELISA were stored at - 18 °C. The significance level was set at 5 % using both Student's t test and two-way ANOVA. Migration of meningioma cells was serum-inducible (p < 0.001). It could be increased by photon IR (p < 0.02). The integrins ανβ1 and ανβ5 showed a 21 and 11 % higher expression after serum stimulation (not significant), respectively, and ανβ1 expression was raised by 14 % (p = 0.0057) after photon IR. Antibody blockage of the integrins ανβ1 and ανβ5 inhibited serum- and photon-induced migration. Expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 remained unchanged after both IR and fetal bovine serum (FBS). Carbon-ion IR left both integrin expression and meningioma cell migration unaffected."}]}

IBS is a heterogeneous disorder, and likely a consequence of both genetic and environmental factors. However, the combined effects of early-life stress and a genetic predisposition to display anxiety- and depression-like behaviors on GI function have not been investigated. We assessed the effect of maternal separation (MS) on behavioral and GI responses in WKY animals relative to a normo-anxious reference strain. Both non-separated (NS) WKY and WKY-MS animals displayed anxiety-like responses in the open-field test and depressive-like behaviors in the forced swim test relative to Sprague-Dawley rats. However, MS had no further influence on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors exhibited by this stress-prone rat strain. Similarly, corticosterone levels measured after the OFT were insensitive to MS in WKY animals.

We show that overexpression of pPLAIIIδ inhibited longitudinal growth but promoted transverse growth in most organs of Arabidopsis and Brassica napus. Compared to wild-type plants, pPLAIIIδ-KO plants exhibited enhanced cell elongation in hypocotyls, and pPLAIIIδ-OE plants displayed broadened radial cell growth of hypocotyl and reduced leaf pavement cell polarity. For the hypocotyl phenotype in pPLAIIIδ mutants, which resembles the \"triple response\" to ethylene, we examined the expression of the ACS and ACO genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and found that ACS4 and ACS5 were up-regulated by 2.5-fold on average in two OE lines compared with WT plants. The endogenous auxin distribution was disturbed in plants with altered pPLAIIIδ expression. pPLAIIIδ-OE and KO plants exhibited different sensitivities to indole-3-acetic acid-promoted hypocotyl elongation in both light and dark conditions. Gene expression analysis of auxin-induced genes in the dark showed that OE plants maintained a higher auxin response compared with WT and KO plants after treatment with 1 μM IAA for 12 h.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was measured in LX-2, an immortalized human HSC cell line. Quantitative realtime PCR, Western blot, immunocytochemical analysis, and in-cell Western blot were performed to determine mRNA and protein of fibrogenic genes, and the activation of Smad3 in TGFβ1-activated LX-2 cells and primary mouse HSCs. In LX-2 cells, ROS accumulation induced by tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide and TGFβ1 was abolished by ASTX. ASTX significantly decreased TGFβ1-induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and procollagen type 1, alpha 1 (Col1A1) mRNA as well as α-SMA protein levels. Knockdown of Smad3 showed the significant role of Smad3 in the expression of α-SMA and Col1A1, but not TGFβ1, in LX-2 cells. ASTX attenuated TGFβ1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation with a concomitant inhibition of Smad3, Smad7, TGFβ receptor I (TβRI), and TβRII expression.

In this study we investigated whether Wnt signaling pathways played roles in 6-BT-induced differentiation of AML cells. We induced differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells and primary AML cells in vitro using 6-BT. Real-time PCR (qPCR), western blot, and luciferase assays were used to examine the molecules' expression and biological activity in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. AML cell differentiation was measured by the Nitroblue tetrozolium (NBT) reduction assay. 6-BT regulated the expression of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling molecules in HL-60 cells. Both 6-BT and all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) reduced canonical Wnt signaling and activated noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in HL-60 cells. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which activated canonical Wnt signaling, partly abolished the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 6-BT. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in inactivation of non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling, abolished 6-BT-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Several molecules in the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway were detected in bone marrow samples from AML patients, and the expression of FZD4, FZD5, Wnt5a and RHOU were significantly reduced in newly diagnosed AML samples compared with normal controls."}]}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Rg3 on erectile function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Two-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received a one-time intraperitoneal (IP) STZ (60 mg/kg) or vehicle injection after a 16-hour fast. Three days later, rats were randomly divided into four groups and were treated with daily gavage feedings of a mix of distilled saline water and 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose or Rg3 dissolved in the mix at doses of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg for 3 months. A sham group underwent IP injection of saline followed by daily gavage of the above mix for 3 months. Erectile function was assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 3 months. The penis was then harvested and deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed. Western blot was performed to examine cleaved caspase-3, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Neural regeneration was measured by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase staining. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected by colorimetry. In the negative control group, the functional evaluation showed a lower mean intracavernosal pressure (ICP) with cavernosal nerve stimulation than in the sham group; there was a significant change in the expression of cleaved caspase-3, bcl-2, bcl-xl, PECAM-1, and SMA, as well as in the SOD and MDA production in the corpus cavernosum. Histological analysis of specimens stained for NADPH showed a significant change in the staining quality of the neurons in the dorsal nerves; TUNEL showed a greater apoptotic index in corpus cavernosum cells. With daily oral gavage with 100 mg/kg Rg3, the ICP/mean arterial pressure value was significantly higher than in the controls. The level of cleaved caspase-3, bcl-2, bcl-xl, PECAM-1, and SMA and the number of positively stained nerve fibers tended to revert to normal after Rg3 treatment.

However, studies to clarify factors predictive of histological change in patients with NASH remain scarce. Our aim is to determine predictors of histological progression in Japanese patients with biopsy-proven NASH. This retrospective cohort study enrolled 52 patients with NASH who underwent serial liver biopsies. Histological evaluation included NAFLD activity score (NAS) and liver fibrosis. The median interval between initial and second liver biopsies was 968 days. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) response was defined as a decrease of 30% or more from baseline. Of 52 patients, NAS was ameliorated in 30.8%, deteriorated in 30.8% and remained unchanged in 38.4%. Liver fibrosis was improved in 25.0% of patients, progressed in 25.0% and remained stable in 50.0%. Multivariate analysis identified ALT non-response as a predictor of deterioration of NAS (hazard ratio [HR], 5.85; P = 0.031) and progression of liver fibrosis (HR, 4.50; P = 0.029).

We investigated the effects of early Notch2 deletion in Notch2(fl/fl)/Alfp-Cre(tg/-) (\"Notch2-cKO\") and Notch2(fl/fl)/Alfp-Cre(-/-) (\"control\") mice. Fetal and neonatal Notch2-cKO livers were devoid of cytokeratin19 (CK19)-, Dolichos-biflorus agglutinin (DBA)-, and SOX9-positive ductal structures, demonstrating absence of prenatal cholangiocyte differentiation. Despite extensive cholestatic hepatocyte necrosis and growth retardation, mortality was only ~15%. Unexpectedly, a slow process of secondary cholangiocyte differentiation and bile-duct formation was initiated around weaning that histologically resembled the ductular reaction. Newly formed ducts varied from rare and non-connected, to multiple, disorganized tubular structures that connected to the extrahepatic bile ducts. Jaundice had disappeared in ~30% of Notch2-cKO mice by 6 months. The absence of NOTCH2 protein in postnatally differentiating cholangiocyte nuclei of Notch2-cKO mice showed that these cells had not originated from non-recombined precursor cells. Notch2 and Hnf6 mRNA levels were permanently decreased in Notch2-cKO livers. Perinatally, Foxa1, Foxa2, Hhex, Hnf1β, Cebpα and Sox9 mRNA levels were all significantly lower in Notch2-cKO than control mice, but all except Foxa2 returned to normal or increased levels after weaning, coincident with the observed secondary bile-duct formation. Interestingly, Hhex and Sox9 mRNA levels remained elevated in icteric 6 months old Notch2-cKOs, but decreased to control levels in non-icteric Notch2-cKOs, implying a key role in secondary bile-duct formation."}]}

Although T cells contribute to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), it is unknown whether negative T cell-dependent TIM-3 co-stimulation may rescue IR-stressed orthotopic liver transplants from innate immunity-driven inflammation. We used wild type (WT) and TIM-3 transgenic (Tg) mice (C57BL/6) as liver donors and recipients in a clinically-relevant model of hepatic cold storage (20 h at 4°C in UW solution) and syngeneic orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Orthotopic liver transplants in WT or TIM-3Tg→TIM-3Tg groups were resistant against IR-stress, evidenced by preserved hepatocellular function (serum ALT levels) and liver architecture (Suzuki's score). In contrast, orthotopic liver transplants in WT or TIM-3Tg→WT groups were susceptible to IRI. TIM-3 induction in circulating CD4+ T cells of the recipient: (1) depressed T-bet/IFN-γ, while amplifying GATA3 and IL-4/IL-10 expression in orthotopic liver transplants; (2) promoted T cell exhaustion (PD-1, LAG-3) phenotype; and (3) depressed neutrophil and macrophage infiltration/function in orthotopic liver transplants. In parallel studies, we documented for the first time that Gal-9, a natural TIM-3 ligand, was produced primarily by and released from IR-stressed hepatocytes, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, exogenous recombinant Gal-9 (rGal-9) potentiated liver resistance against IRI by depressing T cell activation and promoting apoptosis of CD4+ T cells."}]}

Neural stem cells were isolated from the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal day 3. In dose-response experiments, cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) were exposed to different concentrations of ketamine (0-1000 µM) for 24 hrs. The proliferative activity of NSCs was evaluated by 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Apoptosis of neural stem cells were assessed using caspase-3 by western blot. The intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in NSCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. The activation of protein kinase C-α (PKCα) and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were measured by western blot analysis. Clinical relevant concentration of ketamine (10, 20 and 50 µM) did not markedly alter the proliferation of NSCs from neonatal rat hippocampus in vitro. However, ketamine (200, 500, 800 and 1000μM) significantly inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and did not affect the expression of caspase-3. Meanwhile, ketamine (200, 500, 800 and 1000μM) also markedly decreased [Ca(2+)]i as well as suppressed PKCα activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NSCs. A combination of subthreshold concentrations of ketamine (100 μM) and Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (2.5 μM), PKCα inhibitor chelerythrine (2.5 μM) or ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (5 μM) significantly produced suprathreshold effects on PKCα activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NSC proliferation."}]}

Two-dimensional gel-based approaches are limited by the low identification rate of proteins and lack of accurate protein quantitation. The recently developed isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method allows sensitive and accurate protein quantification. Here, we performed the first iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome and phosphorylated proteins analyses during wheat grain development. The proteome profiles and phosphoprotein characterization of the metabolic proteins during grain development of the elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Yanyou 361 were studied using the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome approach, TiO2 microcolumns, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Among 1,146 non-redundant proteins identified, 421 showed at least 2-fold differences in abundance, and they were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 256 upregulated and 165 downregulated proteins. Of the 421 DEPs, six protein expression patterns were identified, most of which were up, down, and up-down expression patterns. The 421 DEPs were classified into nine functional categories mainly involved in different metabolic processes and located in the membrane and cytoplasm. Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the DEPs involved in starch biosynthesis, storage proteins, and defense/stress-related proteins significantly accumulated at the late grain development stages, while those related to protein synthesis/assembly/degradation and photosynthesis showed an opposite expression model during grain development. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 12 representative genes encoding different metabolic proteins showed certain transcriptional and translational expression differences during grain development. Phosphorylated proteins analyses demonstrated that 23 DEPs such as AGPase, sucrose synthase, Hsp90, and serpins were phosphorylated in the developing grains and were mainly involved in starch biosynthesis and stress/defense."}]}

{"query": "Does exosome-mediated transfer of miR-10b promote cell invasion in breast cancer?", "topk": [{"text": "Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin, mediating diverse biological functions including tumor cell invasion, cell-cell communication and antigen presentation through transfer of proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can be released through ceramide-dependent secretory machinery regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) enzyme encoded by the smpd3 gene that triggers exosome secretion. However, whether exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays any role in cell invasion remains poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the exosomal microRNAs involved in breast cancer invasion. The expression level of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR and the expression level of target proteins were detected by western blot. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy were used to characterize exosomes and to study its uptake and transfer. Luciferase reporter plasmids and its mutant were used to confirm direct targeting. Furthermore, the functional significance of exosomal miR-10b was estimated by invasion assay. In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA carrying exosomes can be transferred among different cell lines through direct uptake. miR-10b is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to non-metastatic breast cancer cells or non-malignant breast cells; it is actively secreted into medium via exosomes. In particular, nSMase2 or ceramide promotes the exosome-mediated miR-10b secretion whereas ceramide inhibitor suppresses this secretion. Moreover, upon uptake, miR-10b can suppress the protein level of its target genes such as HOXD10 and KLF4, indicating its functional significance. Finally, treatment with exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells could induce the invasion ability of non-malignant HMLE cells."}]}

Fetuses in paraffin section were stained with H+E and nestin immunohistochemical staining protocol was performed. In this study, in the human meninges intense nestin expression was detected as early as in the 9th week of development. Intensity of this expression gradually decreased in later stages of development and nestin expression still persisted in a small population of newborn meningeal cells."}]}
{"query": "Is dorsal plication without degloving safe and effective for correcting ventral penile deformities?", "topk": [{"text": "To compare the safety and efficacy of patients undergoing dorsal penile plication with patients undergoing ventral and lateral plication. A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent penile plication between 2007 and 2013. Plication was performed through a 2-cm longitudinal incision in the proximal or midpenile shaft without degloving. Plication sutures were placed in parallel opposite the angle of greatest curvature. Dorsal plication was performed with minimal displacement of the neurovascular bundle. Patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes were analyzed. Of 215 patients who underwent penile plication, complete operative and patient-reported outcomes data were available for 118 (55%). Patients were grouped by location of plication: dorsal (n = 17 [14%]), ventral (n = 65 [55%]), and lateral (n = 36 [31%]). Mean age (52-58 years; P = .51) and preoperative curvature (36-51°; P = .78) were similar among the 3 groups. Each group required a similar number of sutures (8-9; P = .18) to achieve similar correction (37-45°; P = .33). Patients completed a satisfaction survey at a mean of 15 months (range, 1-41 months) after surgery. All groups reported equally high rates of satisfaction for penile curvature (P = .64), penile rigidity (P = .64), strength of erection (P = .98), and overall satisfaction (P = .75). Although each group reported subjective decrease in penile length (P = .10), objective length loss occurred on a small scale (mean length loss for all groups, 0.3-0.8 cm; P = .24)."}]}

Argentine Consortium for Early Arthritis (CONAART) is the first early arthritis cohort in Argentina. Patients with one or more swollen joints and less than 2 years of symptoms duration were followed up prospectively in 13 departments of rheumatology. Social, demographic, familiar, clinical, and laboratory data were recollected. At first year and every year, X-rays of hands and feet were performed and working status and pharmaco-economic data were recollected. Work status (employed, unemployed, retired) and type of work were assessed by direct interview using a predesigned questionnaire. Eight hundred forty-eight patients were included, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) = 483 (57 %)and undifferentiated arthritis (UA) = 365 (43 %), 694 (81.8 %) were women, median age was 46 years (interquartile range (IQR) 35-55.7) and median symptoms duration 7 months (IQR 3-12). Patients with RA had significantly higher disease activity, worse functional capacity and quality of life, and more severe radiological damage compared to UA patients. However work disability (unemployed patient) was comparable between groups (RA = 21 % versus UA = 18.6 % p = NS). In both groups, unemployed patients had higher disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28), worse Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) values, and less years of formal education (p value <0.005 in all comparisons). Radiological damage was greater in unemployed patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, disease activity was the main variable associated with unemployment in both groups. Joint involvement was the main cause of work disability in this cohort of patients with early arthritis, independently of the final diagnosis."}]}

It has been reported that abnormal fibrin probably contributes to the incomplete resolution of emboli. And there is evidence that free iron could convert fibrinogen into fibrin which is remarkably resistant to lysis. Thus, we hypothesized that persistent iron overload might participate in the development of CTEPH. A case-control study was conducted. Forty-five CTEPH patients were enrolled as cases, and 36 age and sex frequency-matched chronic PE patients without pulmonary hypertension were selected as controls. Levels of free iron, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, hepcidin-25, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate odds ratios. There was no difference of the levels of free iron, hepcidin-25, sTfR, ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, TNF-α, and MDA between CTEPH patients and the controls. Levels of sTfR and ferritin in both groups were within the normal limits. Levels of IL-6 in CTEPH patients were significantly higher than that in the controls. A negative correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and sTfR (Spearman's r=-0.438, P<.001), and a positive correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and ferritin (Spearman's r=0.503, P<.001).

Lymph nodes with evidence of neoadjuvant treatment effect without residual cancer cells may be observed and are not traditionally considered in pathologic reports, but may have prognostic significance. All patients who underwent esophagectomy after completing neoadjuvant therapy for EAC at our institution between 2006 and 2012 were reviewed. Slides of pathologic specimens were reexamined for locoregional treatment-response nodes lacking viable cancer cells but with evidence of acellular mucin pools, central fibrosis, necrosis, or calcifications suggesting prior tumor involvement. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were estimated, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare staging models. Ninety patients (82 men) underwent esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy for EAC (mean age, 61.8 ± 8.9 years). All patients received preoperative chemotherapy, and 50 patients also underwent preoperative radiotherapy. Median Kaplan-Meier survival was 55.6 months, and 5-year survival was 35% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 62%). A total of 100 treatment-response nodes were found in 38 patients. For patients with limited nodal disease (62 ypN0-N1), the presence of treatment-response nodes was associated with significantly worse survival (p = 0.03) compared with patients lacking such nodes. Adjusting for patient age and AJCC7 pathologic stage showed the presence of treatment-response nodes significantly increased the risk of death (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.9; p = 0.04).

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) possesses antiinflammatory effects. Given that calcification occurs in adult valves, we hypothesized that AVICs from adult valves more likely undergo a proosteogenic phenotypic change than those from pediatric valves and that may be related to different Stat3 activation in the response of those two age groups to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). AVICs from healthy human aortic valve tissues were treated with TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Cellular levels of TLR4, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as phosphorylation of p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), and Stat3, were analyzed. Toll-like receptor 4 protein levels were comparable between adult and pediatric AVICs. Adult cells produce markedly higher levels of the above markers after TLR4 stimulation, which is negatively associated with phosphorylation of Stat3. Inhibition of Stat3 enhanced p-38 MAPK and NF-κβ phosphorylation and exaggerated the expression of the above markers in pediatric AVICs after TLR4 stimulation."}]}
{"query": "Do pollen tube cell walls of wild and domesticated tomatoes contain arabinosylated and fucosylated xyloglucan?", "topk": [{"text": "In flowering plants, fertilization relies on the delivery of the sperm cells carried by the pollen tube to the ovule. During the tip growth of the pollen tube, proper assembly of the cell wall polymers is required to maintain the mechanical properties of the cell wall. Xyloglucan (XyG) is a cell wall polymer known for maintaining the wall integrity and thus allowing cell expansion. In most angiosperms, the XyG of somatic cells is fucosylated, except in the Asterid clade (including the Solanaceae), where the fucosyl residues are replaced by arabinose, presumably due to an adaptive and/or selective diversification. However, it has been shown recently that XyG of Nicotiana alata pollen tubes is mostly fucosylated. The objective of the present work was to determine whether such structural differences between somatic and gametophytic cells are a common feature of Nicotiana and Solanum (more precisely tomato) genera. XyGs of pollen tubes of domesticated (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and var. Saint-Pierre) and wild (S. pimpinellifolium and S. peruvianum) tomatoes and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) were analysed by immunolabelling, oligosaccharide mass profiling and GC-MS analyses. Pollen tubes from all the species were labelled with the mAb CCRC-M1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes epitopes associated with fucosylated XyG motifs. Analyses of the cell wall did not highlight major structural differences between previously studied N. alata and N. tabacum XyG. In contrast, XyG of tomato pollen tubes contained fucosylated and arabinosylated motifs. The highest levels of fucosylated XyG were found in pollen tubes from the wild species."}]}

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 263 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B (94 with cirrhosis) who recovered from a flare of hepatitis with hepatic decompensation and were followed after cessation of lamivudine therapy. Clinical events that occurred during the follow-up period were assessed by chart review and analysis of results from retrospective assays. The mean duration of lamivudine therapy was 12.1 ± 8.6 months; data were collected from patients for 89.1 ± 38.7 months after therapy ended. In the first year off therapy, 29.9% of patients had clinical relapse, 16.2% had hepatitis flares, and 8.2% had hepatic decompensation. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hepatic decompensation between patients with and without cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 14 patients 20-109 months after cessation of therapy, with 5-year cumulative incidence of 5.2% in patients with cirrhosis. Three patients with cirrhosis died of hepatic decompensation 38-76 months after cessation of therapy (5-year cumulative mortality, 2.9%). Multivariate analyses showed that men were more likely than women to have recurrence of hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio [HR], 4.339; P = .014).

Changes induced in specific brain regions by sustained pain may alter the processing of affective information, thus resulting in anxiodepressive disorders. Here, we compared the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the posterior insular cortex in the anxiodepressive, sensory, and affective aspects of chronic pain. Neuropathic pain was induced by cuffing the right sciatic nerve of C57BL/6J mice. Lesions were performed by local injection of ibotenic acid and chronic activation of the ACC by optogenetic stimulation. Anxiodepressive-related behaviors were evaluated through the novelty suppressed feeding, marble burying, splash, and forced swimming tests. Mechanical thresholds were determined using von Frey filaments, and the relief of spontaneous pain was determined by using place conditioning. The ACC lesion prevented the anxiodepressive consequences of chronic pain without affecting the sensory mechanical allodynia. Conversely, the tonic or spontaneous pain and the anxiodepressive consequences of pain remained present after posterior insular cortex lesion, even though the mechanical allodynia was suppressed. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of the ACC was sufficient to induce anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in naïve animals."}]}

Due to its known ability to replace other MRSA clones in hospitals, it became a dominant clone in Europe and beyond. So far, there are no studies investigating the relationship between the epidemiological success of MRSA clones and their capacity to withstand commonly encountered stresses. We investigated the fitness of ST22-IV in comparison with the replaced clone ST228-I, evaluating its resistance to oxidative stress, autolytic activity, growth at high osmolarity and in acid and alkaline environments and survival under desiccation and heat shock. We also compared their phenotypic characteristics and examined the impact of antibiotic consumption on epidemiological success. Here we demonstrate that the dominance of ST22-IV is linked neither to changes in antibiotic consumption nor to acquisition of additional resistances over time.

In a prospective cohort, 300 consecutive patients starting first-line ART were enrolled and followed for 12 months. Among 238 patients with available viral load data at Month 12, logistic regression was used to analyse risk factors for virological failure (≥1000 HIV RNA copies/mL) including clinical, immunological and virological parameters, as well as data on drug adherence. Population sequencing was performed to detect the presence of drug-resistance mutations in patients with virological failure at Month 12; minority drug-resistance mutations at baseline were analysed using next-generation sequencing in these patients and matched controls. At Month 12, 38/238 (16%) patients experienced virological failure (≥1000 HIV RNA copies/mL). Patients with virological failure were younger, had lower CD4 cell counts and were more often WHO stage 3 or 4 at baseline. Sixty-three percent of patients with virological failure developed at least one drug-resistance mutation. The M184V (n = 18) and K103N (n = 10) mutations were most common. At baseline, 6/30 patients (20%) experiencing virological failure and 6/35 (17%) matched controls had evidence of minority drug-resistance mutations using next-generation sequencing (P = 0.77). Lower CD4 count at baseline (OR per 100 cells/mm(3) lower 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.96, P = 0.04) and poorer adherence (OR per 1% lower 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, P < 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of virological failure.

However, clinicopathological biases were not adjusted in these studies. We aimed to clarify the effect of blood transfusions in patients with HCC and Child-Pugh class A after hepatectomy by using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis for selection bias control. We enrolled 479 patients with primary HCC and Child-Pugh class A retrospectively (91 transfused and 388 nontransfused patients) who underwent curative hepatectomy. After adjusting for different covariate distributions for both groups by IPTW, we analyzed the prognostic outcomes. In the unweighted analyses, overall survival (OS) rate of transfused patients was significantly lower than in nontransfused patients (P < 0.0001). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate of transfused patients was significantly lower than that of nontransfused patients (P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis showed that blood transfusion was an independent prognostic factor of OS and RFS. The different distributive covariates between the two groups were age, presence of liver cirrhosis, serum level of alpha-fetoprotein, maximum tumor diameter, and amount of intraoperative blood loss. After IPTW by these covariates, OS rate of transfused patients was not significantly lower than those of nontransfused patients, whereas RFS rate of transfused patients remained significantly lower than those of nontransfused patients (P = 0.038, adjusted HR 1.45; 95% CI 1.0-2.1)."}]}

Drought treatments commenced at flowering. Measurements were taken of soil and leaf water content, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, total soluble sugars and inorganic P content (Pi). Water-use efficiency was greatest under eCO2 when the plants were supplied with adequate P compared with other treatments irrespective of drought treatment. Elevated CO2 decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and increased the concentration of soluble sugars and relative water contents in leaves. Adequate P supply increased concentrations of soluble sugars and Pi in drought-stressed plants. Adequate P supply but not eCO2 increased root length distribution in deeper soil layers."}]}

One tumor-promoting mechanism of microglia/brain macrophages is upregulation of membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP), which promotes the degradation of extracellular matrix. MT1-MMP upregulation is induced by soluble factors released by glioma cells activating microglial Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Versican identified by proteomics was silenced in glioma cells by short interference RNA and short hairpin RNA approaches and studied in vitro and after injection into mouse brains or organotypic brain slices. The splice variants V0/V1 of the endogenous TLR2 ligand versican are highly expressed in mouse and human glioma tissue. Versican-silenced gliomas induced less MT1-MMP expression in microglia both in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in smaller tumors and longer survival rates as compared with controls. Recombinant versican V1 induced significantly higher levels of MT1-MMP in wild-type microglia compared with untreated and treated TLR2 knockout microglial cells. Using glioma-injected organotypic brain slices, we found that the impact of versican signaling on glioma growth depended on the presence of microglia. Moreover, we found that TLR2 expression is upregulated in glioma-associated microglia but not in astrocytes. Additionally, an established TLR2 neutralizing antibody reduced glioma-induced microglial MT1-MMP expression as well as glioma growth ex vivo."}]}

Patients at SNPHs were younger, the percentage of female and minority patients was higher, and patients had a higher Elixhauser comorbidity index (P < .001). Nonelective admissions were more common among SNPH patients who presented with more advanced PAD (P > .05) and symptomatic carotid stenosis (P < .05). Patients at SNPHs had a significantly longer length of stay, higher hospital charges, and higher in-hospital mortality (P < .05 for all variables). Crude odds of mortality at SNPHs were 1.28 higher than at nSNPHs (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.46; P < .001), but adjusted analyses revealed no statistically significant difference between the odds of in-hospital mortality at both hospital groups."}]}
{"query": "Does older age limit postbariatric surgery cognitive benefits : a preliminary investigation?", "topk": [{"text": "Bariatric surgery is associated with cognitive benefits, but the nature of such gains may be variable across demographically and clinically diverse persons. Older adults achieve less weight loss and resolution of fewer medical co-morbidities after surgery compared to younger patients and are also at heightened risk for nutritional deficiencies. However, no study has examined the influence of age on cognitive improvements after bariatric surgery. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of age on cognitive function postbariatric surgery. A total of 95 participants enrolled in the Longitudinal Assessment for Bariatric Surgery completed a computerized cognitive test battery before bariatric surgery and at 12-weeks and 12-months postoperatively. Baseline cognitive impairments were common. Significant improvements were found in attention/executive function and memory abilities 12-weeks and 12-months after surgery. Age was not associated with baseline cognitive test performance. Separate multivariable regression analyses controlling for baseline attention/executive function and memory also showed that age was not a significant predictor of 12-week or 12-month performances in these domains (P>.05 for all)."}]}

{"query": "Does a group of segmental premotor interneurons regulate the speed of axial locomotion in Drosophila larvae?", "topk": [{"text": "Animals control the speed of motion to meet behavioral demands. Yet, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that a class of segmentally arrayed local interneurons (period-positive median segmental interneurons, or PMSIs) regulates the speed of peristaltic locomotion in Drosophila larvae. PMSIs formed glutamatergic synapses on motor neurons and, when optogenetically activated, inhibited motor activity, indicating that they are inhibitory premotor interneurons. Calcium imaging showed that PMSIs are rhythmically active during peristalsis with a short time delay in relation to motor neurons. Optogenetic silencing of these neurons elongated the duration of motor bursting and greatly reduced the speed of larval locomotion."}]}
{"query": "Do plasma membrane-targeted PIN proteins drive shoot development in a moss?", "topk": [{"text": "Plant body plans arise by the activity of meristematic growing tips during development and radiated independently in the gametophyte (n) and sporophyte (2n) stages of the life cycle during evolution. Although auxin and its intercellular transport by PIN family efflux carriers are primary regulators of sporophytic shoot development in flowering plants, the extent of conservation in PIN function within the land plants and the mechanisms regulating bryophyte gametophytic shoot development are largely unknown. We have found that treating gametophytic shoots of the moss Physcomitrella patens with exogenous auxins and auxin transport inhibitors disrupts apical function and leaf development. Two plasma membrane-targeted PIN proteins are expressed in leafy shoots, and pin mutants resemble plants treated with auxins or auxin transport inhibitors. PIN-mediated auxin transport regulates apical cell function, leaf initiation, leaf shape, and shoot tropisms in moss gametophytes. pin mutant sporophytes are sometimes branched, reproducing a phenotype only previously seen in the fossil record and in rare natural moss variants."}]}

We also determined whether changes in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels measured over 2 decades between study initiation and insomnia determination were different for the persistent, intermittent, and never insomnia groups. The results were adjusted for confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, alcohol, and sedatives. Of the 1409 adult participants, 249 (18%) had intermittent and 128 (9%) had persistent insomnia. During a 20-year follow-up period, 318 participants died (118 due to cardiopulmonary disease). In adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models, participants with persistent insomnia (adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.45) but not intermittent insomnia (HR 1.22; 95% CI, 0.86-1.74) were more likely to die than participants without insomnia.

C6 glioma cells were treated with GDNF (70 ng/mL) and membrane and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted. A N-cadherin antibody was used for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Western blot analysis using the co-IP protein was completed using antibodies for β-catenin, Src and β-actin. Immunocytochemistry was conducted with the same antibodies. To determine if Src induced phosphorylation of β-catenin Tyr-654, Western blot analysis was also performed on nuclear proteins from C6 cells treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 using then p- β-catenin antibody. After induced by GDNF, C6 cell membrane β-catenin was phosphorylated at Tyr-654 and subsequently separated from the N-cadherin/β-catenin complex. Further study confirmed that the induction by GDNF significantly increased cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of phospho-β-catenin (Tyr-654) in C6 glioma cells. There was also an increase in the binding of non-receptor protein kinase Src with N-cadherin on the inner cell membrane surface.

The primary predictor was the use of statin medications at the time of index screening PSA test. The main outcome was the screening PSA value. Poisson regressions were performed to calculate adjusted relative risks for having an abnormal screening PSA result according to statin usage. Percentages of men with PSA results exceeding commonly used thresholds of >2.5, >4.0, and >6.5 ng/mL were 21.0%, 7.6%, and 1.6%, respectively.

Guinea-pigs were sensitised with Ova (i.p. 100 or 150 μg) on days 1 and 5 or days 1, 4 and 7 and challenged with nebulised Ova (100 or 300 μg/ml, 1h) on day 15. Airway function was measured in conscious guinea-pigs by whole-body plethysmography to record specific airway conductance (sGaw). Airway responsiveness to aerosolized histamine (0.3mM) was determined before and 24h after Ova challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed for total and differential inflammatory cell counts. Lung sections were stained for counting of eosinophils. Lack of AHR and LAR with the original protocol was confirmed. Increasing the Ova challenge concentration from 100 to 300 μg/ml restored AHR and eosinophils and increased the peak of the EAR.

Porcine aortic pieces were decellularized using sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecylsulphate and implanted subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 per group). The treatment (shock wave therapy, SWT) group received SWs (0.1 mJ/mm(2), 500 impulses, 5 Hz) for modulation of inflammatory response directly after implantation; control animals remained untreated (CTR). Grafts were harvested 72 h and 3 weeks after implantation and analysed for inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration and polarization, osteoclastic activity and calcification. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed. Endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with SWs and analysed for macrophage regulatory cytokines. In an ex vivo experimental set-up, decellularized porcine aortic valve conduits were reseeded with ECs with and without SWT (0.1 mJ/mm(2), 300 impulses, 3 Hz), fibroblasts as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (all human) and tested in a pulsatile flow perfusion system for cell coverage. Treated ECs showed an increase of macrophage migration inhibitory factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, whereas CD40 ligand and complement component C5/C5a were decreased. Subcutaneously implanted grafts showed increased mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 in the treatment group. Enhanced repopulation with recipient cells could be observed after SWT. Augmented macrophage infiltration and increased polarization towards M2 macrophages was observed in treated animals. Enhanced recruitment of osteoclastic cells in proximity to calcified tissue was found after SWT. Consequently, SWT resulted in decreased areas of calcification in treated animals. The reseeding experiment revealed that fibroblasts showed the best coverage compared with other cell types.

Genetic deletion of TR completely repressed weight gain, adiposity and insulin resistance in FFC-fed mice. Moreover, TR(-/-) mice suppressed steatohepatitis, with essentially normal serum ALT, hepatocyte apoptosis and liver triglyceride accumulation. Gene array data implicated inhibition of macrophage-associated hepatic inflammation in the absence of the TR. In keeping with this, there was diminished accumulation and activation of inflammatory macrophages in liver and adipose tissue. TR(-/-) BMDMϕ manifest reduced chemotaxis and diminished activation of nuclear factor-κ B signaling upon activation by palmitate and lipopolysaccharide."}]}

There is limited knowledge related to readmissions after esophagectomy for malignancy. Our aim was to determine the impact on survival of readmission after esophagectomy. This cohort study utilizes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data (2002 to 2009). Survival, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and discharge disposition were determined. Multivariate logistic regression models were created to examine risk factors associated with readmission. In all, 1,744 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy: 80% of patients (1,390) were male, and mean age was 73 years; 71.8% of tumors (1,251) were adenocarcinomas, and 72.5% (1,265) were distal esophageal tumors; 38% of patients (667) received induction therapy. Operative approach was transthoracic in 52.6% of patients (918) and transhiatal in 37.4% (653), and required complex reconstruction (intestinal interposition) in 9.9% (173). Stage distribution was as follows: stage I, 35.3% (616); stage II, 32.5% (566); stage III, 27.9% (487); and stage IV, 2.3% (40). Median length of stay was 13 days, hospital mortality was 9.3% (158 patients), and 30-day readmission rate was 18.6% (212 of 1,139 home discharges); 25.4% of patients (443) were discharged to institutional care facilities.

However the mechanisms involved remain unknown. We investigated whether supplementation with a pomegranate extract rich in polyphenols renders beneficial effects on coronary function in a clinically relevant experimental model and characterized the underlying mechanisms. Pigs were fed a 10-day normocholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic diet. Half of the animals were given a supplement of 625 mg/day of a pomegranate extract (Pomanox; 200 mg punicalagins/day). Coronary responses to escalating doses of vasoactive drugs (acetylcholine, calcium ionophore, and sodium nitroprusside) and L-NG-monomethylarginine (endothelial nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor) were measured using flow Doppler. Akt/endothelial nitric oxide-synthase axis activation, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression, oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid damage in the coronary artery, and lipoprotein resistance to oxidation were evaluated. In dyslipidemic animals, Pomanox supplementation prevented diet-induced impairment of endothelial relaxation, reaching vasodilatory values comparable to normocholesterolemic animals upon stimulation with acetylcholine and/or calcium ionophore. These beneficial effects were associated with vascular Akt/endothelial nitric oxide-synthase activation and lower monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression. Pomanox supplementation reduced systemic oxidative stress (higher high-density lipoprotein-antioxidant capacity and higher low-density lipoprotein resistance to oxidation) and coronary deoxyribonucleic acid damage. Normocholesterolemic animals elicited similar drug-related vasodilation regardless of Pomanox supplementation. All animals displayed a similar vasodilatory response to sodium nitroprusside and L-NG-monomethylarginine blunted all vasorelaxation responses except for sodium nitroprusside."}]}

Prospective data on the prevalence and prognostic impact of malnutrition in patients with HCC are scarce. Fifty-one consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were prospectively enrolled into this study and screened for malnutrition by anthropometric measurements, the MNA score, the NRS score, laboratory work-up, and BIA measurement. The results of the different screening tools were compared to each other and with the BIA assessment and correlated with the outcome of patients. The calculation of a body mass index (BMI) was not suitable to identify malnourished patients with HCC. The MNA identified 19, the NRS score 17 patients at a risk for malnutrition. BIA revealed a reduction in relative body cell mass in 12 patients. Univariate Cox regression analyses identified tumor stage, MNA score, and phase angle obtained by BIA as significant factors with influence on survival.

{"query": "Is sinR a mutational target for fine-tuning biofilm formation in laboratory-evolved strains of Bacillus subtilis?", "topk": [{"text": "Bacteria often form multicellular, organized communities known as biofilms, which protect cells from a variety of environmental stresses. During biofilm formation, bacteria secrete a species-specific matrix; in Bacillus subtilis biofilms, the matrix consists of protein polymers and exopolysaccharide. Many domesticated strains of B. subtilis have a reduced ability to form biofilms, and we conducted a two-month evolution experiment to test whether laboratory culturing provides selective pressure against biofilm formation in B. subtilis. Bacteria grown in two-month-long batch culture rapidly diversified their biofilm-forming characteristics, exhibiting highly diverse colony morphologies on LB plates in the initial ten days of culture. Generally, this diversity decreased over time; however, multiple types of colony morphology remained in our final two-month-old populations, both under shaking and static conditions. Notably, while our final populations featured cells that produce less biofilm matrix than did the ancestor, cells overproducing biofilm matrix were present as well. We took a candidate-gene approach to identify mutations in the strains that overproduced matrix and found point mutations in the biofilm-regulatory gene sinR. Introducing these mutations into the ancestral strain phenocopied or partially phenocopied the evolved biofilm phenotypes."}]}
{"query": "Does ancient DNA provide new insight into the maternal lineages and domestication of Chinese donkeys?", "topk": [{"text": "The donkey (Equus asinus) is an important domestic animal that provides a reliable source of protein and method of transportation for many human populations. However, the process of domestication and the dispersal routes of the Chinese donkey are still unclear, as donkey remains are sparse in the archaeological record and often confused with horse remains. To explore the maternal origins and dispersal route of Chinese donkeys, both mitochondrial DNA D-loop and cytochrome b gene fragments of 21 suspected donkey remains from four archaeological sites in China were amplified and sequenced. Molecular methods of species identification show that 17 specimens were donkeys and three samples had the maternal genetic signature of horses. One sample that dates to about 20,000 years before present failed to amplify. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis reveals that ancient Chinese donkeys have high mitochondrial DNA diversity and two distinct mitochondrial maternal lineages, known as the Somali and Nubian lineages. These results indicate that the maternal origin of Chinese domestic donkeys was probably related to the African wild ass, which includes the Nubian wild ass (Equus africanus africanus) and the Somali wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis). Combined with historical records, the results of this study implied that domestic donkeys spread into west and north China before the emergence of the Han dynasty. The number of Chinese domestic donkeys had increased primarily to meet demand for the expansion of trade, and they were likely used as commodities or for shipping goods along the Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty, when the Silk Road reached its golden age."}]}

In total, we obtained serum samples from 90 PDR cases, 90 matched NPDR patients and 20 controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression was performed through TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA). The candidate miRNAs were validated by individual reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) arranged in an initial and a two-stage validation sets. Moreover, additional double-blind testing was performed in 20 patients clinically suspected of having DR to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the serum miRNA profiling system in predicting PDR. Three miRNAs were significantly increased in patients with PDR compared with NPDR after the multiple stages. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the validated three-serum miRNAs signature were 0.830, 0.803 and 0.873 in the initial and two validation sets, respectively. Combination of miR-21, miR-181c, and miR-1179 possessed a moderate ability to discrimination between PDR and NPDR with an area under ROC value of 0.89.

This study tested the hypothesis that serum DHEA and DHEA-S are predictors of major coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or cerebrovascular disease (CBD) events in a large cohort of elderly men. We used gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze baseline levels of DHEA and DHEA-S in the prospective population-based Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study in Sweden (2,416 men, ages 69 to 81 years). Complete cardiovascular clinical outcomes were available from national Swedish registers. During the 5-year follow-up, 302 participants experienced a CHD event, and 225 had a CBD event.

In contrast, DHEA/-S showed no statistically significant association with the risk of CBD events. The association between DHEA and CHD risk remained significant after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, serum total testosterone and estradiol, C-reactive protein, and renal function, and remained unchanged after exclusion of the first 2.6 years of follow-up to reduce reverse causality."}]}

Collagenolytic activity of the wild-type and mutant strains was determined, demonstrating that colAh encodes for a collagenase. ColAh-collagen interaction was assayed by Far-Western blot, and cytopathic effects were investigated in Vero cells. We demonstrated that ColAh is a gluzincin metallopeptidase (approx. 100 kDa), able to cleave and physically interact with collagen, that contributes for Aeromonas collagenolytic activity and cytotoxicity. ColAh possess the consensus HEXXH sequence and a glutamic acid as the third zinc binding positioned downstream the HEXXH motif, but has low sequence similarity and distinct domain architecture to the well-known clostridial collagenases.

Expression of BMPR2, of the BMP agonist BMP4, and of the BMP antagonists gremlin1 and gremlin2 was evaluated in lungs and in PA-SMCs from 6 PAH patients and 14 controls treated with endothelin-1. Endothelin-1 pre-treated PA-SMCs were assessed for proliferation, apoptosis, and downstream signaling activation of Smad1/5/8 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) after BMP2 treatment. In PA-SMCs from PAH patients, expression of BMPR2 and BMP4 decreased, whereas expression of gremlin1 and gremlin2 increased compared with controls. Treatment of control PA-SMCs with endothelin-1 induced a dose-dependent increase in gremlin1 and gremlin2, whereas BMPR2 and BMP4 expression decreased, reaching similar levels as those observed in PAH cells. In control PA-SMCs, endothelin-1 pre-treatment reduced inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) expression and Smad1/5/8 activation induced by BMP2, whereas it enhanced p38(MAPK) activation. Moreover, BMP2 decreased serum-induced proliferation and increased the pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These effects were attenuated by endothelin-1 pre-treatment.

Here, we describe for the first time that activated mECs are able to induce reparative neovascularization in ischemic zones by releasing TF-rich microparticles. We show in vitro and in vivo that mEMPs released by both wild-type and TF-upregulated-mECs induce angiogenesis and collateral vessel formation, whereas TF-poor mEMPs derived from TF-silenced mECs are not able to trigger angiogenesis. Isolated TF-bearing mEMPs delivered to nonperfused adductor muscles in a murine hindlimb ischemia model enhance collateral flow and capillary formation evidenced by MRI. TF-bearing mEMPs increase angiogenesis operating via paracrine regulation of neighboring endothelial cells, signaling through the β1-integrin pathway Rac1-ERK1/2-ETS1 and triggering CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) production to form new and competent mature neovessels."}]}

Four novel peptides (HYNIC-GGGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-GSGNle-CycMSHhex, HYNIC-PEG2Nle-CycMSHhex, and HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex) were designed and synthesized. The melanocortin-1 receptor binding affinities of the peptides were determined in B16/F1 melanoma cells. The biodistribution of (99m)Tc(ethylenediaminediacetic acid [EDDA])-HYNIC-GGGNle-CycMSHhex, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-GSGNle-CycMSHhex, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-PEG2Nle-CycMSHhex, and (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were determined in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing C57 mice at 2 h after injection to select a lead peptide for further evaluation. The melanoma targeting and imaging properties of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-AocNle-CycMSHhex were further examined because of its high melanoma uptake.

Using multiplex, ligation-dependent probe amplification on formalin-fixed core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens before NAC and surgical specimens after NAC. BRCAness status was assessed with the assessor unaware of the clinical information. We obtained 45 CNB and 60 surgical specimens from the 73 patients. Of the 45 CNB specimens, 17 had BRCAness (38.6% of all subtypes). Of the 23 TNBC CNB specimens, 14 had BRCAness (61% of TNBC cases). The clinical response rates were significantly lower for BRCAness than for non-BRCAness tumors, both for all tumors (58.8% vs. 89.3%, P = .03) and for TNBC (50% vs. 100%, P = .02). All tumors that progressed with taxane therapy had BRCAness. Of the patients with TNBC, those with non-BRCAness cancer had pathologic complete responses significantly more often than did those with BRCAness tumors (77.8% vs. 14.3%, P = .007). After NAC, the clinical response rates were significant lower for BRCAness than for non-BRCAness tumors in all subtypes (P = .002) and in TNBC cases (P = .008).

In addition, antioxidants showed significant inhibitory effects on the CSFV replication, indicating a close relationship between CSFV replication and OS induced in the host cells."}]}
{"query": "Does e2F4 regulatory program predict patient survival prognosis in breast cancer?", "topk": [{"text": "Genetic and molecular signatures have been incorporated into cancer prognosis prediction and treatment decisions with good success over the past decade. Clinically, these signatures are usually used in early-stage cancers to evaluate whether they require adjuvant therapy following surgical resection. A molecular signature that is prognostic across more clinical contexts would be a useful addition to current signatures. We defined a signature for the ubiquitous tissue factor, E2F4, based on its shared target genes in multiple tissues. These target genes were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using a probabilistic method. We then computationally calculated the regulatory activity score (RAS) of E2F4 in cancer tissues, and examined how E2F4 RAS correlates with patient survival. Genes in our E2F4 signature were 21-fold more likely to be correlated with breast cancer patient survival time compared to randomly selected genes. Using eight independent breast cancer datasets containing over 1,900 unique samples, we stratified patients into low and high E2F4 RAS groups. E2F4 activity stratification was highly predictive of patient outcome, and our results remained robust even when controlling for many factors including patient age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node (LN) status, whether the patient received adjuvant therapy, and the patient's other prognostic indices such as Adjuvant! and the Nottingham Prognostic Index scores. Furthermore, the fractions of samples with positive E2F4 RAS vary in different intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, consistent with the different survival profiles of these subtypes."}]}

Relationships between body fat changes and change in Short Form-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores were investigated using mixed-model regression. We studied 270 HIV+ and 247 HIV- men. At baseline, ≥50% of HIV+ men reported body fat changes; physical component but not mental component summary scores were lower among HIV+ men who reported moderate/severe leg or abdominal fat changes (p<0.05). At follow-up, physical component summary scores were significantly lower among men with face, leg, or abdominal fat changes compared to men without perceived fat changes (p<0.05). No significant changes were seen in mental component scores by fat change location or severity. In the final model, body fat changes at any site or severity were significant predictors of a decline in physical component summary score (p<0.05), independent of demographics or comorbidities.

Here we investigated cortical excitability in episodic CH patients by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. In 25 patients with episodic CH and 13 healthy subjects we evaluated the motor cortical response to single-pulse (ie, motor threshold, input-output curves, cortical silent period) and paired-pulse (ie, intracortical facilitation, short intracortical inhibition) transcranial magnetic stimulation in both hemispheres. Thirteen patients were evaluated outside bout and the remaining 12 patients inside bout. Our results showed increased slope of the input-output curves after stimulation of both hemispheres in patients outside bout and in the hemisphere contralateral to the headache side in patients inside bout. Increased intracortical facilitation was observed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the headache side in patients evaluated both outside and inside bout; reduced short intracortical inhibition was observed in patients inside bout ipsilateral to the side of pain. In conclusion, we provide evidence of increased cortical excitability in episodic CH both outside and inside bout, especially in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the side of headache attacks. Our results suggest that an abnormal regulation of cortical excitability could be involved in the pathophysiology of CH."}]}
{"query": "Is motor cortical activity during motor tasks normal in patients with complex regional pain syndrome?", "topk": [{"text": "Motor dysfunction in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often considered a functional movement disorder. Earlier studies in patients with functional movement disorders found evidence of cortical inhibition during explicit but not implicit motor tasks, suggesting active inhibition from other brain areas. In this study, we explored whether active inhibition occurs in CRPS patients. We compared patients with CRPS with 2 control groups: healthy controls matched for age and sex, and patients whose hand was immobilized to treat a scaphoid fracture. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure corticospinal excitability at rest and during motor imagery (explicit motor task) and motor observation (implicit motor task). Motor corticospinal excitation measured at rest and during implicit and explicit motor tasks was similar for CRPS patients and healthy controls. Patients with an immobilized hand showed an absence of motor cortical excitation of the corresponding hemisphere during motor imagery of tasks involving the immobilized hand, but not during motor observation. The normal motor cortical processing during motor imagery and motor observation found in the corresponding hemisphere of CPRS patients suggests that the nature of motor dysfunction in this condition differs from that described in literature for patients with functional paresis or under circumstances of limb immobilization."}]}
{"query": "Does peripheral group I metabotropic glutamate receptor activation lead to muscle mechanical hyperalgesia through TRPV1 phosphorylation in the rat?", "topk": [{"text": "Elevated glutamate levels within injured muscle play important roles in muscle pain and hyperalgesia. In this study, we hypothesized that protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent TRPV1 phosphorylation contributes to the muscle mechanical hyperalgesia following activation of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5). Mechanical hyperalgesia induced by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), an mGlu1/5 agonist, in the masseter muscle was attenuated by AMG9810, a specific TRPV1 antagonist. AMG9810 also suppressed mechanical hyperalgesia evoked by pharmacologic activation of PKC. DHPG-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was suppressed by pretreatment with a decoy peptide that disrupted interactions between TRPV1 and A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP), which facilitates phosphorylation of TRPV1. In dissociated trigeminal ganglia, DHPG upregulated serine phosphorylation of TRPV1 (S800), during which DHPG-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was prominent. The TRPV1 phosphorylation at S800 was suppressed by a PKC inhibitor. Electrophysiologic measurements in trigeminal ganglion neurons demonstrated that TRPV1 sensitivity was enhanced by pretreatment with DHPG, and this was prevented by a PKC inhibitor, but not by a protein kinase A inhibitor. These results suggest that mGlu1/5 activation in masseter afferents invokes phosphorylation of TRPV1 serine residues including S800, and that phosphorylation-induced sensitization of TRPV1 is involved in masseter mechanical hyperalgesia. These data support a role of TRPV1 as an integrator of glutamate receptor signaling in muscle nociceptors."}]}

Eighty-six patients with HCC undergoing liver resection were retrospectively studied. N- and E-cadherin expression in HCC and adjacent liver tissue were investigated using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The correlation between the expression status of both cadherins and surgical outcomes was analyzed. In 23 patients negative for E-cadherin expression, 19 of them (82.6%) were also negative for N-cadherin expression. In 30 patients with heterogeneous expression of E-cadherin, 20 of them (66.7%) also had heterogeneous expression of N-cadherin. In 33 patients with uniformly positive expression of E-cadherin, 19 of them (57.6%) also had uniformly positive expression of N-cadherin. Therefore, there was a positive correlation between expression patterns of N- and E-cadherins. Concurrent loss of both N- and E-cadherin expressions was significantly associated with absence of the tumor capsule, vascular invasion, and poor differentiation. The 1- and 3-y disease-free survival rates were 27% and 9%, respectively, and the 1- and 3-y overall survival rates were 64.3% and 14.3%, respectively, in patients with concurrent loss of both cadherins, which were significantly worse than those with concurrent uniformly positive expression or heterogeneous expression of both cadherins."}]}

After S100A3-specific small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) treatment, cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and apoptotic cell fractions were evaluated by flow cytometry. The invasive properties of these cells and the expression pattern of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were assessed using transwell migration assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and gelatin zymography. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of S100A3 inhibition on human CRPC cells was investigated using human tumor xenograft models in nude mice. Human CRPC cells showed overexpression of S100A3, and its suppression reduced cell viability owing to apoptotic cell death. Additionally, S100A3 inhibition decreased the invasiveness of human CRPC cells. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated in PC3, whereas only MMP-9 was downregulated in D145 after S100A3 inhibition.

Thus, we aimed to (1) confirm the previous association on a large series of volunteers and (2) test the hypothesis that the SNP could affect microRNA binding sites. The association analysis was verified in 759 subjects. Then, in silico predictions highlighted miR-611 and miR-887 as candidate miRNAs binding to the polymorphic site. Thus, chimeric constructs bearing the alternative alleles (G > A) were assayed alone or in cotransfection with the miRNA mimics, with dual luciferase reporter assay in non-MPM Met-5A cells. The miRNAs were also assayed by western blot analysis for their ability to down-regulate endogenous mesothelin in the MPM Mero-14 cell line. We confirmed that, among non-MPM volunteers, GG homozygotes have the lowest SMRP levels. When the genotype is taken into account, the specificity of SMRP as biomarker improves from 79.7% to 85.3%. Dual-luciferase assays showed a significantly lower reporter activity when the vector harbored the G allele as compared to A allele. miR-887 mimic caused a reduced reporter activity of vectors harboring A or G alleles, while miR-611 was effective only on the vector harboring the G allele.

{"query": "Are fascial closure after open abdomen : initial indication and early revisions decisive factors -- a retrospective cohort study?", "topk": [{"text": "The surgical treatment method in which the peritoneal cavity is opened anteriorly and deliberately left open, hence often called \"open abdomen\" has become the standard of care in damage-control procedures as well as in the management of intra-abdominal hypertension and in severe intra-abdominal sepsis. Whereas open abdomen has been closed in two stages traditionally, a modern trend is to close the fascial layers within the initial hospitalization to avoid complications like enterocutaneous fistula and hernia formation. The aim of this study was to determine crucial factors influencing the possibility of fascial closure after open abdomen. Between 2003 and 2013, 355 adult patients were treated with open abdomen in our institution. Their data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into two groups depending on fascial closure or not (fascial closure, n = 137 (39%) vs. non-fascial closure, n = 218 (61%)). The patients who reached fascial closure had a significantly higher rate of initially performed open abdomen (97 patients (71%) vs. 118 (54%), p = 0.002) and the periods of time until a second and a third look operation were significantly shorter (2.7 ± 2.5 vs. 4.2 ± 6.6 days, p = 0.021 and 5.6 ± 3.7 vs. 8.5 ± 8.6 days, p = 0.006).

The hypothesis was tested by means of subcutaneous injection of human muscle precursor cells from the rectus abdominis muscle into nude mice (n = 18). Animals injected with human fibroblasts, prostate cancer cells, or collagen served as control animals (four in each group). T1, T2, T2*, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured at 4.7-T MR imaging. MR imaging parameters were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. The engineered muscle was characterized by means of immunofluorescence, Western blot, and contraction assays. Muscle tissue in the early stages of the differentiation process exhibited distinctly higher T1 (mean ± standard deviation, 2242 msec ± 116), T2 (224 msec ± 18), and T2* (33.3 msec ± 3.6) values and ADCs (1.53 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.03) compared with those of skeletal muscle. The muscle precursor cells exhibited a nonspecific pattern compared with that in control animals in the early stages.

Previous studies mainly focused on individual responses and a limited number of systemic leaves, and more research is needed for a better understanding of how different plant parts respond to herbivory. In the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, FACs (fatty acid-amino acid conjugates) in Manduca sexta oral secretions (OS) are the major elicitors that induce herbivory-specific signaling but their role in systemic signaling is largely unknown. Here, we show that simulated herbivory (adding M. sexta OS to fresh wounds) dramatically increased SIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase) activity and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in damaged leaves and in certain (but not all) undamaged systemic leaves, whereas wounding alone had no detectable systemic effects; importantly, FACs and wounding are both required for activating these systemic responses. In contrast to the activation of SIPK and elevation of JA in specific systemic leaves, increases in the activity of an important anti-herbivore defense, trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI), were observed in all systemic leaves after simulated herbivory, suggesting that systemic TPI induction does not require SIPK activation and JA increases. Leaf ablation experiments demonstrated that within 10 minutes after simulated herbivory, a signal (or signals) was produced and transported out of the treated leaves, and subsequently activated systemic responses."}]}

Hepatic lipid content, lipid clearance, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion were determined between OB and OB-Nrf2KO mice. OB-Nrf2KO mice exhibited decreased white adipose tissue mass and decreased adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression compared with OB mice. Nrf2 deficiency prolonged hyperglycemia in response to glucose challenge, which was paralleled by reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In OB mice, Nrf2 deficiency decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) content, and enhanced VLDL secretion. However, this observation was opposite in lean mice. Additionally, OB-Nrf2KO mice exhibited increased plasma triglyceride content, decreased HDL-cholesterol content, and enhanced apolipoprotein B expression, suggesting Nrf2 deficiency caused dyslipidemia in these mice."}]}

Using deep sequencing technology, a total of 685 miRNAs were investigated in a group of alveolar RMSs (ARMSs), embryonal RMSs (ERMSs) as well as in normal skeletal muscle (NSM). Q-PCR, MTT, cytofluorimetry, migration assay, western blot and immunofluorescence experiments were carried out to determine the role of miR-378a-3p in cancer cell growth, apoptosis, migration and differentiation. Bioinformatics pipelines were used for miRNA target prediction and clustering analysis. Ninety-seven miRNAs were significantly deregulated in ARMS and ERMS when compared to NSM. MiR-378 family members were dramatically decreased in RMS tumour tissue and cell lines. Interestingly, members of the miR-378 family presented as a possible target the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), a key signalling molecule in RMS. MiR-378a-3p over-expression in an RMS-derived cell line suppressed IGF1R expression and affected phosphorylated-Akt protein levels. Ectopic expression of miR-378a-3p caused significant changes in apoptosis, cell migration, cytoskeleton organization as well as a modulation of the muscular markers MyoD1, MyoR, desmin and MyHC. In addition, DNA demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was able to up-regulate miR-378a-3p levels with a concomitant induction of apoptosis, decrease in cell viability and cell cycle arrest in G2-phase.

The objectives of this study were to describe women's experiences of abortion care in their own words, and to determine themes across patient experiences. Data for this thematic analysis, a qualitative method that allows for the identification, analysis, and report of patterns or themes within data, come from a larger study of safety and quality of aspiration abortion care across 22 clinical sites. Participants completed an abortion experience survey including fixed choice questions and an open-ended question: \"Is there anything you would like to tell us about your experience?\" The data were then categorized by responses to another survey question: \"Overall, was your experience about, better, or worse than you expected?\" A total of 5,214 responses were analyzed. Women reported positive abortion care experiences with the majority of women rating their experience as better than expected (n = 3,600). Two major themes that emerged from the data include clinic- and patient-level factors that impact how patients rate their experiences. Analysis of the responses categorized in the worse than expected group (n = 136) found that women primarily faulted clinic-level factors for their negative experiences, such as pain control and management, and wait time for appointments and in clinic."}]}

{"query": "Does the T-box transcription factor Brachyury promote renal interstitial fibrosis by repressing E-cadherin expression?", "topk": [{"text": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β1 is one of well-recognized factors contributing to renal fibrosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of EMT are not fully understood. Brachyury, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, was recently identified as an important factor promoting EMT in human carcinoma cell lines. There is no evidence that Brachyury is involved in renal tubular EMT. Our results demonstrated that Brachyury was prominently induced in TGF-β1-treated human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells and that this induction was accompanied by changes characteristic of EMT. Blockage of Brachyury expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in HK-2 cells effectively reversed the TGF-β1-induced EMT phenotype. Brachyury induction repressed E-cadherin transcription; the E-cadherin promoter contains a Brachyury binding site, and decreased expression of E-cadherin occurred in Brachyury-overexpressing cells when they were transfected with reporter constructs using the promoter. This effect was partially mediated by Slug and Snail, as knockdown of Snail and Slug by siRNA effectively reversed Brachyury-mediated EMT and partially restored E-cadherin expression. The expression of Brachyury also presented in a rat model of obstructive nephropathy and in tubulointerstitial fibrosis tissues of IgA nephropathy, suggesting that it may have a role in EMT and renal fibrosis in vivo."}]}

A total of 1246 patients were included in this study, with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 80 ± 13 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Proteinuria was present in 290 patients (23.4%). Postoperative acute kidney injury developed in 434 patients (34.8%), and 36 patients (2.9%) required renal replacement therapy. Proteinuria was independently associated with all stages of postcardiotomy acute kidney injury and dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury. The crude risk of acute kidney injury was greater in patients with a higher grade of proteinuria. In subgroup analysis for gender, diabetes, and surgical type, preoperative proteinuria remains a strong risk factor of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery."}]}

Seventeen intact (>3-cm) bowel segments (15 small and 2 large intestine) from 12 patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease were procured immediately after surgical resection. Ultrasound shear wave elastography of the bowel wall was performed by two methods (Virtual Touch Quantification [VTQ] and Virtual Touch-IQ [VT-IQ]; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Mountain View, CA). Eighteen short-axis shear wave speed measurements were acquired from each specimen: 3 from the 9-, 12-, and 3-o'clock locations for each method. Imaging was performed in two areas for specimens greater than 10 cm in length (separated by ≥5 cm). A gastrointestinal pathologist scored correlative histologic slides for inflammation and fibrosis. Differences in mean shear wave speed between bowel segments with low and high inflammation/fibrosis scores were assessed by a Student t test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed. High-fibrosis score (n = 11) bowel segments had a significantly greater mean shear wave speed than low-fibrosis score (n = 6) bowel segments (mean ± SD: VTQ, 1.59 ± 0.37 versus 1.18 ± 0.08 m/s; P= .004; VT-IQ, 1.87 ± 0.44 versus 1.50 ± 0.26 m/s; P= .049). There was no significant difference in mean shear wave speed between high-and low-inflammation score bowel segments (P > .05 for both VTQ and VT-IQ).

{"query": "Does phosphorylation of BK channels modulate the sensitivity to hydrogen sulfide ( H2S )?", "topk": [{"text": "Gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), termed gasotransmitters, play an increasingly important role in understanding of how electrical signaling of cells is modulated. H2S is well-known to act on various ion channels and receptors. In a previous study we reported that H2S increased calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel activity. The goal of the present study is to investigate the modulatory effect of BK channel phosphorylation on the action of H2S on the channel as well as to recalculate and determine the H2S concentrations in aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) solutions. Single channel recordings of GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells were used to analyze channel open probability, amplitude, and open dwell times. H2S was measured with an anion selective electrode. The concentration of H2S produced from NaHS was recalculated taking pH, temperature salinity of the perfusate, and evaporation of H2S into account. The results indicate that from a concentration of 300 μM NaHS, only 11-13%, i.e., 34-41 μM is effective as H2S in solution. GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells respond differently to phosphorylation. BK channel open probability (Po) of all cells lines used was increased by H2S in ATP-containing solutions. PKA prevented the action of H2S on channel Po in GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not in GH3 cells. H2S, high significantly increased Po of all PKG pretreated cells. In the presence of PKC, which lowers channel activity, H2S increased channel Po of GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not those of GH3 cells. H2S increased open dwell times of GH3 cells in the absence of ATP significantly. A significant increase of dwell times with H2S was also observed in the presence of okadaic acid."}]}

The effects of CHE and liver disease are determined by cognitive reserve—the ability of the brain to cope with increasing damage while continuing to function—and are assessed by composite intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We examined cognitive reserve as a determinant of HRQOL in patients with cirrhosis. We performed a prospective study of 118 outpatients with cirrhosis without overt HE (age, 56 y). We studied cognition using the standard paper-pencil battery; patients with below-normal results for more than 2 tests were considered to have CHE. We also assessed HRQOL (using the sickness impact profile [SIP]), psychosocial and physical scores (a high score indicates reduced HRQOL), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, and cognitive reserve (using the Barona Index, a validated IQ analysis, based on age, race, education, residence area, and occupation). Cognitive reserve was divided into average and high groups (<109 or >109), and MELD and SIP scores were compared. We performed regression analyses, using total SIP score and psychosocial and physical dimensions as outcomes, with cognitive reserve, CHE, and MELD score as predictors. Study participants had average MELD scores of 9, and 14 years of education; 81% were white, 63% were urban residents, their mean IQ was 108 ± 8, and 54% had average cognitive reserve (the remaining 46% had high reserves).

We previously found adult transgenic mouse hearts expressing the fetal troponin I isoform, (ssTnI) to be protected from ischemia by increased glycolysis. In this study, we investigated the metabolic response of adult mouse hearts expressing ssTnI to chronic pressure overload. At 2 to 3 months of age, ssTnI mice or their nontransgenic littermates underwent aortic constriction (TAC). TAC induced a 25% increase in nontransgenic heart size but only a 7% increase in ssTnI hearts (P<0.05). Nontransgenic TAC developed diastolic dysfunction (65% increase in E/A ratio), whereas the E/A ratio actually decreased in ssTnI TAC. Isolated perfused hearts from nontransgenic TAC mice showed reduced cardiac function and reduced creatine phosphate:ATP (16% reduction), but ssTnI TAC hearts maintained cardiac function and energy charge. Contrasting nontransgenic TAC, ssTnI TAC significantly increased glucose oxidation at the expense of palmitate oxidation, preventing the increase in anaplerosis observed in nontransgenic TAC hearts. Elevated glucose oxidation was mediated by a reduction in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression, enabling pyruvate dehydrogenase to compete against anaplerotic enzymes for pyruvate carboxylation."}]}

Between 2012 and 2013, telephone interviews were conducted with participants in four Missouri metropolitan areas. Questions included sociodemographic characteristics, home and workplace supports for PA, and dietary behaviors. Data analysis was conducted in 2013; logistic regression was used to examine associations between BE features and domain-specific PA. In home neighborhoods, seven of 12 BE features (availability of fruits and vegetables, presence of shops and stores, bike facilities, recreation facilities, crime rate, seeing others active, and interesting things) were associated with leisure PA. The global average score of home neighborhood BE features was associated with greater odds of travel PA (AOR=1.99, 95% CI=1.46, 2.72); leisure PA (AOR=1.84, 95% CI=1.44, 2.34); and total PA (AOR=1.41, 95% CI=1.04, 1.92). Associations between workplace neighborhoods' BE features and workplace PA were small but in the expected direction."}]}

This study evaluated the longitudinal association between maternal regulation of TV content and the amount of TV watched by low-income ethnic minority children. This was a secondary data analysis of the Welfare, Children & Families: A Three City Study. Data were used from ethnic minority mothers with a child from birth to 4 years old, collected over two waves approximately 16 months apart. The dependent variable was the amount of TV watched by the child (wave two). The main independent variable was the maternal regulation of TV content (wave one). Using multiple linear regression, we evaluated the relationship between maternal regulation of TV content and the amount of TV watched by the child, adjusting for covariates. Of the 835 mothers, 71% were high content regulators and 8% reported no content regulation. Children whose mothers reported no regulation watched more TV approximately 16 months later than those whose mothers reported high regulation of content (β = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.09-1.73)."}]}

{"query": "Do human adenovirus Ad36 and its E4orf1 gene enhance cellular glucose uptake even in the presence of inflammatory cytokines?", "topk": [{"text": "Aging and obesity are associated with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, which are linked to insulin resistance. Anti-inflammatory agents have marginal effect in improving insulin resistance. Hence, agents are needed to improve glycemic control despite the inflammation. Ad36, a human adenovirus, increases TNFα and MCP1 mRNA in adipose tissue, yet improves glycemic control in mice. Ad36 via its E4orf1 gene, up-regulates AKT/glucose transporter (Glut)-4 signaling to enhance cellular glucose uptake. Directly test a role of Ad36, or E4orf1 in enhancing cellular glucose uptake in presence of inflammatory cytokines. Experiment 1: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0, 10 or 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and infected with 0 or 5 plaque forming units (PFU) of Ad36/cell. 3T3-L1 cells that stably and inducibly express E4orf1 or a null vector (pTRE-E4orf1 or pTRE-null cells), were similarly treated with LPS and then with doxycycline, to induce E4orf1. Experiment 2: 3T3L1 preadipocytes were treated with 25 nM MCP1 or 20 nM TNFα for 16 h, followed by infection with 0 or 5 PFU of Ad36/cell. Experiment 3: pTRE-E4orf1 or -null cells were similarly treated with MCP1 or TNFα followed by doxycycline to induce E4orf1. Cellular glucose uptake and cellular signaling were determined 72 h post-Ad36 infection or E4orf1-induction, in continued presence of MCP1 or TNFα. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Ad36, but not E4orf1, increased MCP1 and TNFα mRNA, in presence of LPS stimulation.

This study investigates the effect of mutation of dmr1 on resistance to the ascomycete pathogens Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, which cause Fusarium Ear Blight (FEB) disease on small grain cereals. We initially found that the dmr1-2 mutant allele confers increased resistance to F. culmorum and F. graminearum silique infection, and decreased colonisation of rosette leaves. Meanwhile the dmr1-1 allele supports less rosette leaf colonisation but has wild type silique resistance. Three additional dmr1 alleles were subsequently examined for altered F. culmorum susceptibility and all showed increased silique resistance, while leaf colonisation was reduced in two (dmr1-3 and dmr1-4). Amino acid analysis of dmr1 siliques revealed homoserine accumulation, which is undetectable in wild type plants. Exogenous application of L-homoserine reduced bud infection in both dmr1 and wild type plants, whilst D-homoserine application did not. Delayed leaf senescence was also observed in dmr1 plants compared to wild type and correlated with reduced Fusarium leaf colonisation."}]}

The combination of PGD2 and cysLTs (notably cysteinyl leukotriene E4 [LTE4]) enhances TH2 cytokine production. However, the synergistic interaction of cysLTs with PGD2 in promoting TH2 cell activation is still poorly understood. The receptors for these mediators are drug targets in the treatment of allergic diseases, and hence understanding their interaction is likely to have clinical implications. We aimed to comprehensively define the roles of PGD2, LTE4, and their combination in activating human TH2 cells and how such activation might allow the TH2 cells to engage downstream effectors, such as neutrophils, which contribute to the pathology of allergic responses. The effects of PGD2, LTE4, and their combination on human TH2 cell gene expression were defined by using a microarray, and changes in specific inflammatory pathways were confirmed by means of PCR array, quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, Luminex, flow cytometry, and functional assays, including analysis of downstream neutrophil activation. Blockade of PGD2 and LTE4 was tested by using TM30089, an antagonist of chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells, and montelukast, an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1. PGD2 and LTE4 altered the transcription of a wide range of genes and induced diverse functional responses in TH2 cells, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival and cytokine production. The combination of these lipids synergistically or additively enhanced TH2 responses and, strikingly, induced marked production of diverse nonclassical TH2 inflammatory mediators, including IL-22, IL-8, and GM-CSF, at concentrations sufficient to affect neutrophil activation."}]}

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are common factors in their pathogenesis. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is the master regulator of oxidative stress, and melatonin is an endogenous hormone with antioxidative properties that reduces its levels with ageing. We have designed a new compound that combines the effects of melatonin with Nrf2 induction properties, with the idea of achieving improved neuroprotective properties. Compound ITH12674 is a hybrid of melatonin and sulforaphane designed to exert a dual drug-prodrug mechanism of action. We obtained the proposed hybrid in a single step. To test its neuroprotective properties, we used different in vitro models of oxidative stress related to neurodegenerative diseases and brain ischaemia. ITH12674 showed an improved neuroprotective profile compared to that of melatonin and sulforaphane. ITH12674 (i) mediated a concentration-dependent protective effect in cortical neurons subjected to oxidative stress; (ii) decreased reactive oxygen species production; (iii) augmented GSH concentrations in cortical neurons; (iv) enhanced the Nrf2-antioxidant response element transcriptional response in transfected HEK293T cells; and (v) protected organotypic cultures of hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation from stress by increasing the expression of haem oxygenase-1 and reducing free radical production."}]}

Some urban bird species increase their song frequencies so that they can be heard above low-frequency background city noise. However, the ability to make such song modifications may be constrained by several morphological factors, including bill gape, size, and shape, thereby limiting the degree to which certain species can vocally adapt to urban settings. We examined the relationship between song characteristics and bill morphology in a species (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) where both vocal performance and bill size are known to differ between city and rural animals. We found that bills were longer and narrower in more disturbed, urban areas. We observed an increase in minimum song frequency of urban birds, and we also found that the upper frequency limit of songs decreased in direct relation to bill morphology."}]}

Although the expression of NO synthases has been detected in human granulosa cells, the effect of NO on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in these cells remains unknown. The purpose of this article was to investigate the effects of NO on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in human granulosa cells. SVOG cells are human granulosa cells that were obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization and immortalized with simian virus 40 large T antigen. SVOG cells were used to investigate the effects of NO on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. The study was conducted in an academic research center. The levels of mRNA and protein were examined by RT-quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The accumulation levels of PGE2 were measured by ELISA. Treatment with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. In addition, the stimulatory effect of SNAP on COX-2 and PGE2 was mimicked by treatment with the cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP). Interestingly, neither SNAP nor 8-Br-cGMP affected the expression of COX-1.

This result implied the critical role of miR-219-5p in the development of PTC. We investigated the association between miR-219-5p and PTC development. Expression of miR-219-5p was monitored in 30 PTC tissue specimens and compared with that in 30 normal thyroid tissue specimens. The effect of miR-219-5p on PTC development was studied by cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis assays. The underlying mechanism was clarified by a reporter assay and rescue experiment. The current study confirmed that miR-219-5p expression was inhibited in PTC tissue samples. There were statistically significant differences in the expression of miR-219-5p with regard to sex, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC. Forced expression of miR-219-5p suppressed PTC cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis. Further study showed that estrogen receptor (ER) α was the direct target of miR-219-5p and mediated the effect of miR-219-5p on PTC occurrence. Expression of miR-219-5p was inversely correlated with that of ERα. Importantly, ERα overexpression in PTC cells rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-219-5p on PTC cell proliferation and migration.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interaction of Body Mass Index (BMI) with inflammation and cortisol in modulating HR in older subjects. We analyzed data of 895 participants aged 65+ enrolled in the \"InCHIANTI\" study, in sinus rhythm, and not taking beta blockers or digoxin. Linear regression was performed to assess the adjusted association between HR, IL-6, and cortisol levels. The model was also analyzed stratifying for BMI tertiles. Logistic regression was adopted for evaluating the association of HR exceeding the mean value with Il-6 and serum cortisol. According to multivariable linear regression, IL-6 and cortisol levels were associated with HR (B = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.43-2.42; p = .005 and B = .34, 95% CI = 0.17-.51; p < .0001, respectively).

{"query": "Do plant traits respond to the competitive neighbourhood at different spatial and temporal scales?", "topk": [{"text": "Clonal plants can plastically modify their traits in response to competition, but little is known regarding the spatio-temporal scale at which a competitive neighbourhood determines the variability in species traits. This study tests the hypothesis that the local neighbourhood can be expected to influence the processes that are involved in competition tolerance and avoidance, and that this effect depends on organ lifespan. Fragments of the rhizomatous Elytrigia repens (Poaceae) were sampled in 2012 in experimental plant communities that varied in species identity and abundance. These communities had been cultivated since 2009 in mesocosms in a common garden. Fragment performance, shoot and clonal traits were measured, and the effects of past and present local neighbourhoods of five different radius sizes (5-25 cm) were examined. Past and present local neighbourhood compositions were assessed in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Most of the measured traits of E. repens responded to the local neighbourhood (5-10 cm radius), with an additional effect of the larger neighbourhood (20-25 cm radius) on ramet height, leaf dry matter content, maximal internode length and specific rhizome mass. Contrary to the expectation of the hypothesis, the temporal influence was not due to the organ lifespan. Indeed, five of the eight traits studied responded to both the past and present neighbourhoods. With the exception of specific rhizome mass, all trait responses were explained by the abundance of specific species."}]}

Immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the interaction and intracellular distribution of Prdx1 and a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family protein, p38 MAPK, in PDAC cells. Finally, immunocytochemistry and Matrigel invasion assay were used to examine the effects of Prdx1 and p38 MAPK on the formation of cell protrusions and PDAC cell invasion. Prdx1 is overexpressed in human PDAC tissues. Peroxiredoxin 1 interacts with active forms of p38 MAPK, and complexes of Prdx1 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK localize at the leading edges of migrating PDAC cells. Suppression of Prdx1 decreases active p38 MAPK localized in cell protrusions and inhibits the invasiveness of PDAC cells. Consequently, suppression of Prdx1 inhibits membrane ruffling and protrusions. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 also decreases the formation of membrane protrusions and inhibits invasiveness."}]}

Three episodes of heat exposure (42 °C, 30 min/day, 3 days) significantly decreased endogenous H2S production and down-regulated the expression of CBS and CSE in testes. In primary cultured testicular germ cells, exogenous application of NaHS (an H2S donor) attenuated heat stress (42 °C, 30 min) induced cell death and apoptosis. This was mediated by the inhibitory effects of H2S on cytochrome C release and the ratio of the Bax/Bcl-2.

{"query": "Does docosahexaenoic acid induce M2 macrophage polarization through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation?", "topk": [{"text": "Impaired resolution of acute inflammation results in development of chronic inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis, asthma and arthritis. Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by M2 macrophages, the process termed efferocytosis, is critical for complete resolution of inflammation as it prevents secondary necrosis caused by disgorgement of toxic contents from apoptotic cells in the inflamed site. In the present study, we investigated the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on efferocytosis. To determine the effect of DHA on efferocytosis, murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells were co-incubated with apoptotic Jurkat T cells, and efferocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression and production of M1 and M2 markers were determined by RT-PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. To demonstrate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in DHA-mediated effects, siRNA against PPARγ was utilized. The expression of PPARγ was examined by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. The PPARγ activation was measured by the electrophilic gel shift assay. DHA enhanced the efferocytic ability of RAW264.7 cells, and induced their M2 polarization. Notably, knockdown of PPARγ abolished the stimulatory effect of DHA on M2 polarization as well as efferocytosis. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly inhibited by DHA, suggesting that DHA alters the macrophage phenotype in favor of M2 while it suppresses M1 polarization."}]}

We examined the antiproliferative action of a novel imidazoline compound S43126, and the role of the I1-imidazoline receptor, ROS, MAPKs and caspases in S43126-induced cell death. PC 12 cells were treated with various concentrations of S43126 in the presence or absence of several ligands, and the effects on cell proliferation, ROS levels, and apoptosis were evaluated using Trypan Blue, Alamar Blue, Western blot and microscopy. We showed that S43126 reduced PC12 cell proliferation by greater than 50%, increased cell death by greater than 40% and increased apoptotic body formation. These effects were reversed by I1R-antagonist, efaroxan. S43126 also increased intracellular ROS levels by greater than 2.5-fold relative to vehicle-treated control. These effects were significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, pharmacologic inhibitors of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, significantly reduced S43126-induced antiproliferative activity. Caspases 3, 8 and 9 were all activated in a time-dependent manner by S43126. Pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, ameliorated the effects of S43126 on cell death and cell proliferation."}]}

Forty-two adult females Sprague Dawley divided in five groups were treated with oral doses of 25, 50 and 75mg/kg/6h of PHT for 3 days and two additionally groups were treated with intraperitoneal (ip) doses of 25mg/kg/6h or 100mg/kg/24h. At day 4 PHT plasma concentrations were measured and, obtained several organs, brain, parotid gland, liver and duodenum in which were analyzed for the Pgp expression. At day 4 PHT plasma concentrations were measured and several tissues: brain, parotid gland, liver and duodenum were obtained in order to analyze Pgp expression. In order to evaluate the oral bioavailability of PHT, two groups were administered with oral or intraperitoneal doses of 100mg/kg and plasma level were measured. An induction of the expression of efflux transporter mediated by phenytoin in a concentration-and-time dependent manner was found when increasing oral and ip doses of phenytoin, One week after the interruption of ip treatment a basal expression of transporters was recovered."}]}

Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have documented brain volume reductions in acute AN, but it is unclear whether they are 1) regionally specific, or 2) reversible following weight restoration. Here, we measured cortical thickness (CT) for the first time in AN. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from adolescent and young adult female patients with acute AN (n = 40), recovered patients following long-term weight restoration (n = 34), and an equal number of age-matched healthy control subjects. Group differences in CT were tested with well-validated procedures implemented in FreeSurfer. The mediating role of clinical variables including body mass index and drive for thinness were explored. For completeness, we also used FreeSurfer's subcortical segmentation stream to test group differences in volumes of select gray matter regions of interest. Vertex-wise analyses revealed significant thinning of over 85% of the cortical surface in patients with acute AN and CT normalization in recovered patients following long-term weight restoration, although normal age-related trajectories were absent in the disorder. This pattern of results was largely mirrored in subcortical volumes. We also observed a strong negative correlation between CT and drive for thinness in extrastriate regions involved in body perception."}]}

One hundred fifty-four patients with severe AS (aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm(2)) referred to a heart valve clinic from 2004 to 2011 were studied. Thirty patients were asymptomatic, with normal LV ejection fractions (≥ 55%), without other significant valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities. Thirty-two symptomatic patients who underwent early aortic valve replacement, with similar age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and aortic valve area, were selected for comparison. Both groups were also compared with 32 healthy subjects with similar age and gender distributions and normal echocardiographic results who served as controls. LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and rotation were measured using speckle-tracking software applied to archived echocardiographic studies. Conventional echocardiographic and myocardial mechanical parameters were compared among the study subgroups. Patients with asymptomatic severe AS demonstrated smaller reductions in longitudinal strain, higher (supernormal) apical circumferential strain (-38 ± 6% vs -35 ± 4%, P < .05), and extreme (supernormal) apical rotation (12.2 ± 4.9° vs 2.9 ± 1.7°, P < .0005) compared with symptomatic patients.

Referred hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia were tested using von Frey filaments applied to the suprapubic region and plantar region of the hindpaw, respectively. To confirm that suprapubic nociception represented referred visceral bladder hyperalgesia, we recorded abdominal visceromotor responses (VMR) to slow (100 μl/min) and fast (1 cc/sec) bladder filling with room temperature or ice-cold saline. We assessed the development of hyperalgesia over the 10-day WAS protocol and the durability of increased pain sensations over time. Animals exposed to chronic WAS had significantly lower hindpaw withdrawal thresholds post-stress and significant differences in referred hyperalgesia. Rats exposed to chronic WAS demonstrated an increased pain response to suprapubic stimulation and decreased response threshold to mechanical hindpaw stimulation by day 8 of the stress protocol, which persisted for more than one month. Animals exposed to chronic WAS showed increased VMR to fast filling and ice water testing in comparison to sham animals.

Chronic pancreatitis was defined based on the detection of characteristic changes by cross-sectional abdominal imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, or histology analyses. Patients were asked by a physician or trained clinical research coordinator if they had any abdominal pain during the year before enrollment, those who responded \"yes\" were asked to select from a list of 5 pain patterns. By using these patterns, we classified patients' pain based on timing and severity. Abnormal pancreatitis-associated features on abdominal imaging were recorded using standardized case report forms. Data were collected from 518 patients (mean age, 52 ± 14.6 y; 55% male; and 87.6% white). The most common physician-identified etiologies were alcohol (45.8%) and idiopathic (24.3%); 15.6% of patients reported no abdominal pain in the year before enrollment. The most common individual pain pattern was described as constant mild pain with episodes of severe pain and was reported in 45% of patients. The most common imaging findings included pancreatic ductal dilatation (68%), atrophy (57%), and calcifications (55%).

Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT) and permeability surface area product (PS) were computed in the suspected PCa area and in normal prostatic tissue. PCa was visible in pCT in 90 of the 94 examined patients as a focal peripheral CT enhancement. When PCa was located in the peripheral zone (PZ), it was visible on perfusion maps, mostly showing an early peak followed by wash-out. The average values of all perfusion parameters were higher for tumour than for normal prostate tissue (p < 0.000). BV and BF were dependent on tumour grade expressed by the Gleason score (GS). All PCa cases were divided into groups, according to histological grade, as low (GS ≤ 6), medium (GS = 7), and high (GS > 7). In high-grade PCa, the mean BF value was significantly higher (p = 0.001) than the mean value of BF low- and medium-grade PCa (p = 0.011).

Additionally, we examined the midbrain regulation of both dopamine signaling and cocaine seeking by the stress-sensitive peptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Combining fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with behavioral pharmacology, we examined the effect of intraoral quinine administration on nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling and hedonic expression in 21 male Sprague-Dawley rats. We tested the role of CRF in modulating aversion-induced changes in dopamine concentration and cocaine seeking by bilaterally infusing the CRF antagonist, CP-376395, into the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that quinine rapidly reduced dopamine signaling on two distinct time scales. We determined that CRF acted in the VTA to mediate this reduction on only one of these time scales. Further, we found that the reduction of dopamine tone and quinine-induced cocaine seeking were eliminated by blocking the actions of CRF in the VTA during the experience of the aversive stimulus."}]}

Foliage of plants inoculated with either rhizobia or AMF was treated with both live Colletotrichum gloeosporioides-a generalist hemibiotrophic plant pathogen-and C. gloeosporioides fragments. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activity in leaves and roots, as well as the number of rhizobia nodules and the extent of AMF colonization, were measured after pathogen treatments.

{"query": "Does gender influence headache characteristics with increasing age in migraine patients?", "topk": [{"text": "Migraine headache is one of the most common primary headache disorders and is three times more prevalent in women than in men, especially during the reproductive ages. The neurobiological basis of the female dominance has been partly established. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on the headache manifestations in migraine patients. The study group consisted of 2082 adult patients from five different hospitals' tertiary care-based headache clinics. The relationship between headache characteristics and gender was evaluated in migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA). The duration, severity, frequency of headache and associated symptoms were evaluated in both genders and age-dependent variations and analyzed in two subgroups. Women with migraine were prone to significantly longer duration and intensity of headache attacks. Nausea, phonophobia and photophobia were more prevalent in women. Median headache duration was also longer in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.013) and MwoA (p < 0.001). Median headache intensity was higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.010) and MwoA (p = 0.009). The frequency of nausea was significantly higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.049). Throbbing headache quality and associated features (nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) were significantly more frequent in women than in men in MwoA. The gender impact varied across age groups and significant changes were seen in female migraineurs after age 30. No age-dependent variation was observed in male migraineurs."}]}

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a pathogenic interaction of the environmental toxin piericidin A and the P301S mutation. Transgenic mice expressing human tau with the P301S-mutation (P301S+/+) and wild-type mice at 12 weeks of age were treated subcutaneously with vehicle (N = 10 P301S+/+, N = 7 wild-type) or piericidin A (N = 9 P301S+/+, N = 9 wild-type mice) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d for a period of 28 days via osmotic minipumps. Tau pathology was measured by stereological counts of cells immunoreative with antibodies against phosphorylated tau (AD2, AT8, AT180, and AT100) and corresponding Western blot analysis. Piericidin A significantly increased the number of phospho-tau immunoreactive cells in the cerebral cortex in P301S+/+ mice, but only to a variable and mild extent in wild-type mice. Furthermore, piericidin A led to increased levels of pathologically phosphorylated tau only in P301S+/+ mice. While we observed no apparent cell loss in the frontal cortex, the synaptic density was reduced by piericidin A treatment in P301S+/+ mice."}]}

Deletions and duplications of the Williams-syndrome region have also been associated with autism, and with schizophrenia, two disorders centrally involving social cognition. Several lines of evidence have linked the gene GTF2I (General Transcription Factor IIi) with the social phenotypes of Williams syndrome, but a role for this gene in sociality within healthy populations has yet to be investigated. We genotyped a large set of healthy individuals for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the GTF2I gene that have recently been significantly associated with autism, and thus apparently exhibit functional effects on autism-related social phenotypes. GTF2I genotypes for these SNPs showed highly significant association with low social anxiety combined with reduced social-communication abilities, which represents a metric of the Williams-syndrome cognitive profile as described from previous studies."}]}

Changes in body weight were related to changes in blood pressure by linear regression (n = 1875) adjusted for cofounders. Incident hypertension, incident cardiovascular events, or incident blood pressure normalization in patients who were hypertensive at baseline were investigated using Poisson regression (n = 3280) models. A change of 1 kg in body weight was positively associated with a change of 0.45 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.55 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure, 0.32 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.25-0.38 mm Hg) in diastolic blood pressure, and 0.36 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.29-0.43 mm Hg) in mean arterial pressure (all p-values <0.001).

All venous (portal vein-superior mesenteric vein) and arterial (superior mesenteric artery-hepatic artery) reconstructions were extracted and reviewed to determine survival and perioperative complications. During the 10-year study period, 270 Whipple and total pancreatectomy procedures were performed, of which 183 were for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Of the 183 operations, a total of 60 (32.8%) vascular reconstructions were found, 49 venous and 11 arterial. Venous reconstruction included 37 (61.7%) primary repairs, four (6.7%) reconstructions with CryoVein (CryoLife, Inc, Kennesaw, Ga), three (5.0%) repairs with autologous vein patch, three (5.0%) autologous saphenous reconstructions, and two (3.33%) portacaval shunts. In addition, there were 11 (18.3%) arterial reconstructions (seven hepatic artery and four superior mesenteric artery). The 1-year survival for all reconstructions was 71.1%, which is equivalent to T3 lesions that did not receive vascular reconstruction (70.11%), with a median survival time of 575.28 days and 12 patients still alive. Survival time was comparable with each type of venous reconstruction, averaging 528 days (11 of 49 patients still alive).

The expression of urothelial receptors was determined using conventional immunohistochemistry in bladders from normal Sprague-Dawley rats. The urothelial layer was removed by incubation with protamine, and disruption of the urothelium was confirmed using haematoxylin and eosin staining on bladder sections. Open cystometry was used to determine the effects of both urothelial removal as well as intravesical application of a specific P2X3R antagonist on bladder properties from intact and protamine-treated rats. Isometric contractile responses to potassium chloride (KCl) depolarization, electrical field stimulation (EFS) or chemical P2X activation were determined in normal and urothelium-denuded bladder strips, with and without application of the P2X3R antagonist. Immunohistochemical staining showed high expression of P2X3R in the medial and basal layers of the urothelium. Removal of the urothelial layer disturbed normal bladder performance in vivo and eliminated the effects of the P2X3R antagonist on increasing the contractile interval and reducing the amplitude of voiding contractions. Removal of the urothelium did not affect bladder strip contractile responses to KCl depolarization or EFS. Pharmacological inhibition of P2X3R prevented desensitization to P2X-mediated detrusor muscle contractions during EFS only in the strips with an intact urothelium. A concentration-dependent, specific inhibition of P2X3R also prevented desensitization of purinergic contractile responses in intact bladder strips."}]}
{"query": "Does high lifetime inbreeding depression counteract the reproductive assurance benefit of selfing in a mass-flowering shrub?", "topk": [{"text": "Decreases in mate and/or pollinator availability would be expected to affect the selective pressure on plant mating systems. An increase in self-fertilization may evolve to compensate for the negative effects of pollination failure. However, the benefit of selfing in variable pollination environments depends on the relative fitnesses of selfed and outcrossed progeny. We investigated the potential for selfing to provide reproductive assurance over the lifetime of a long-lived perennial species and its variation between plant patches of various sizes. Patch size is likely to affect mate and pollinator availabilities, thereby affecting pollination success and the rate of selfing. We estimated fruit and seed set, reproductive assurance, self-compatibility, the multilocus patch selfing rate and lifetime inbreeding depression in natural patches of Rhododendron ferrugineum (Ericaceae), a mass-flowering species characterized by considerable patch size variation (as estimated by the total number of inflorescences). Open seed set declined linearly with increasing patch size, whereas pollinator-mediated seed set (emasculated flowers) was not significantly affected. Progeny array analysis indicated that the selfing rate declined with increasing patch size, consistent with greater reproductive assurance in small sparse patches than in large, dense patches. However, fruit set and adult fitness decreased with decreasing patch size, with an estimated mean lifetime inbreeding depression of 0.9 (obtained by comparing F values in adults and progenies)."}]}

{"query": "Does measurement of refractive index by nanoparticle tracking analysis reveal heterogeneity in extracellular vesicles?", "topk": [{"text": "Optical techniques are routinely used to size and count extracellular vesicles (EV). For comparison of data from different methods and laboratories, suitable calibrators are essential. A suitable calibrator must have a refractive index (RI) as close to that of EV as possible but the RI of EV is currently unknown. To measure EV, RI requires accurate knowledge of size and light scattering. These are difficult to measure as most EVs cannot be resolved by light microscopy and their diameter is smaller than the wavelength of visible light. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) provides both size and relative light scattering intensity (rLSI) values. We therefore sought to determine whether it was possible to use NTA to measure the RI of individual EVs. NTA was used to measure the rLSI and size of polystyrene and silica microspheres of known size and RI (1.470 and 1.633, respectively) and of EV isolated from a wide range of cells. We developed software, based on Mie scattering code, to calculate particle RI from the rLSI data. This modelled theoretical scattering intensities for polystyrene and silica microspheres of known size (100 and 200 nm) and RI. The model was verified using data from the polystyrene and silica microspheres. Size and rLSI data for each vesicle were processed by the software to generate RI values. The following modal RI measurements were obtained: fresh urinary EV 1.374, lyophilised urinary EV 1.367, neuroblastoma EV 1.393, blood EV 1.398, EV from activated platelets 1.390, small placental EV 1.364-1.375 and 1.398-1.414 for large placental EV (>200 nm).

However, these effects have mainly been demonstrated using animal models of schizophrenia-like deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. Another schizophrenia-relevant abnormality that is the basis of a predictive animal test for APD efficacy is deficient latent inhibition (LI). LI is the normal suppression of a classically conditioned response when the subject is pre-exposed to the conditioned stimulus (CS) before it is paired with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Conditioned taste aversion (CTA), the normal avoidance of ingesting a food or liquid by animals when its taste is associated with an aversive experience, was used to test whether OT facilitates LI consistent with APDs. Brown Norway rats, known to naturally display attenuated LI, were aversively conditioned on two consecutive exposures to flavored drinking water (0.1% saccharin) by pairing it with malaise-inducing lithium chloride injections. Concurrent with conditioning, rats received subcutaneous OT (0.02, 0.1, 0.5mg/kg) or saline. Some rats were pre-exposed to the flavored water prior to its aversive conditioning (pre-exposed) while others were not (non pre-exposed). Two days after aversive conditioning the amount of flavored water consumed during a 20-min session was recorded. As expected, LI, defined as greater consumption by pre-exposed vs. non pre-exposed rats was only weakly exhibited in Brown Norway rats and OT enhanced LI by reducing CTA in pre-exposed rats in a dose-dependent manner, with the 0.02 mg/kg dose producing the strongest effect."}]}

Only one subject experienced a ≥50% PSA decline. Thus, the primary endpoint was not achieved. Seven patients experienced smaller PSA declines (<50%). There was also a significant lengthening of the on-treatment PSA doubling time (PSADT) compared with the pre-treatment PSADT [6.1 months pre-treatment vs. 9.6 months on-treatment (p = 0.044)]. Finally, treatment with sulforaphane-rich extracts was safe with no Grade 3 adverse events."}]}

However, little is known about the efficacy of these drugs in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). We investigated whether beta-blocker therapy affects the clinical outcomes of CLI patients. Between March 2004 and December 2011, 1,873 consecutive CLI patients who received endovascular therapy (EVT) (394 BB-treated patients and 1,479 non-BB-treated patients) for de novo infrainguinal lesions were identified retrospectively. A propensity score analysis was used for risk adjustment in a multivariable analysis and one-to-one matching (BB: 305, non-BB 305). The primary endpoint was amputation-free survival (AFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival and the rates of limb salvage and freedom from major adverse limb events (MALE; including repeat reintervention, surgical conversion and major amputation). The mean follow-up period was 22 ± 15 months. In the propensity score-matched pair analysis, there were no significant differences in AFS between the patients treated with and without beta-blockers (58.8% vs. 58.5% at three years, log-rank p = 0.76).

The association between MR-proADM and AF recurrence was tested by univariable and multivariable Cox models. In all 87 patients radiofrequency ablation was successfully performed. Of the total population 54% had paroxysmal AF. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 54% (minimum 25%). After 12months of follow-up, 71% of the patients were free of AF recurrence. At baseline, mean MR-proADM in the total population was 0.72nmol/l±0.22. Patients with AF recurrence had significantly higher baseline MR-proADM (0.89nmol/l±0.29) as compared with patients without AF recurrence (0.65nmol/l±0.14; p<0.001). After 12months, mean MR-proADM plasma concentration remained higher in patients with AF recurrence (0.81nmol/l±0.22 as compared with patients free of AF 0.54nmol/l±0.20; p<0.001).

Early studies have demonstrated that myocardial blood flow during CPR is largely dependent on peripheral vascular resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chest compression in combination with physical control of peripheral vascular resistance assisted by tourniquets on myocardial blood flow during CPR. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 7 min in ten male domestic pigs weighing between 33 and 37 kg. The animals were then randomized to receive CPR alone or a tourniquet assisted CPR (T-CPR). In the CPR alone group, chest compression was performed by a miniaturized mechanical chest compressor. In the T-CPR group, coincident with the start of resuscitation, the thin elastic tourniquets were wrapped around the four limbs from the distal end to the proximal part. After 2 min of CPR, epinephrine (20 μg/kg) was administered via the femoral vein. After 5 min of CPR, defibrillation was attempted by a single 150 J shock. If resuscitation was not successful, CPR was resumed for 2 min before the next defibrillation. The protocol was continued until successful resuscitation or for a total of 15 min. Five minutes after resuscitation, the elastic tourniquets were removed. The resuscitated animals were observed for 2h. T-CPR generated significantly greater coronary perfusion pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and carotid blood flow. There was no difference in both intrathoracic positive and negative pressures between the two groups. All animals were successfully resuscitated with a single shock in both groups.

{"query": "Does unilateral Hypothalamus Inactivation prevent PTZ Kindling Development through Hippocampal Orexin Receptor 1 Modulation?", "topk": [{"text": "Epilepsy is a neural disorder in which abnormal plastic changes during short and long term periods lead to increased excitability of brain tissue. Kindling is an animal model of epileptogenesis which results in changes of synaptic plasticity due to repetitive electrical or chemical sub-convulsive stimulations of the brain. Lateral hypothalamus, as the main niche of orexin neurons with extensive projections, is involved in sleep and wakefulness and so it affects the excitability of the brain. Therefore, we investigated whether lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) inactivation or orexin-A receptor blocking could change convulsive behavior of acute and kindled PTZ treated animals and if glutamate has a role in this regard. Kindling was induced by 40 mg/kg PTZ, every 48 hours up to 13 injections to each rat. Three consecutive stages 4 or 5 of convulsive behavior were used to ensure kindling. Lidocaine was injected stereotaxically to inactivate LHA, unilaterally. SB334867 used for orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) blocking administered in CSF. We demonstrated that LHA inactivation prevented PTZ kindling and hence, excitability evolution. Hippocampal glutamate content was decreased due to LHA inactivation, OX1R antagonist infusion, lidocaine injection and kindled groups. In accordance, OX1R antagonist (SB334867) and lidocaine injection decreased PTZ single dose induced convulsive behavior. While orexin-A i.c.v. infusion increased hippocampal glutamate content, it did not change PTZ induced convulsive intensity."}]}

Phase II is a consequence of peripheral and central sensitization processes, which can lead to termination of the noxious stimuli responses; 45-60 minutes after formalin injection via possible recruitment of active inhibitory mechanisms which we have investigated in this study. To test our hypothesis, in the first set of experiments, we evaluated nociceptive response after two consecutive injection of formalin (50µL, 2%), with intervals of 5 or 60 minutes. In the next set, formalin tests were carried out in companion with injection of Naloxone Hydrochloride, a non-selective antagonist of opioid receptors, pre-formalin injection and 30 and 45 minutes post formalin injection.

{"query": "Are genes related to emphysema enriched for ubiquitination pathways?", "topk": [{"text": "Increased small airway resistance and decreased lung elasticity contribute to the airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The lesion that corresponds to loss of lung elasticity is emphysema; the small airway obstruction is due to inflammatory narrowing and obliteration. Despite their convergence in altered physiology, different mechanisms contribute to these processes. The relationships between gene expression and these specific phenotypes may be more revealing than comparison with lung function. We measured the ratio of alveolar surface area to lung volume (SA/V) in lung tissue from 43 smokers. Two samples from 21 subjects, in which SA/V differed by >49 cm2/mL were profiled to select genes whose expression correlated with SA/V. Significant genes were tested for replication in the 22 remaining subjects. The level of expression of 181 transcripts was related to SA/V ( p < 0.05). When these genes were tested in the 22 remaining subjects as a replication, thirty of the 181 genes remained significantly associated with SA/V (P < 0.05) and the direction of association was the same in 164/181. Pathway and network analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in protein ubiquitination, and western blotting showed altered expression of genes involved in protein ubiquitination in obstructed individuals."}]}
{"query": "Does unravelling associations between unassigned mass spectrometry peak with frequent itemset mining techniques?", "topk": [{"text": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments generate spectra that are rich in information. Often only a fraction of this information is used for peptide/protein identification, whereas a significant proportion of the peaks in a spectrum remain unexplained. In this paper we explore how a specific class of data mining techniques termed \"frequent itemset mining\" can be employed to discover patterns in the unassigned data, and how such patterns can help us interpret the origin of the unexpected/unexplained peaks. First a model is proposed that describes the origin of the observed peaks in a mass spectrum. For this purpose we use the classical correlative database search algorithm. Peaks that support a positive identification of the spectrum are termed explained peaks. Next, frequent itemset mining techniques are introduced to infer which unexplained peaks are associated in a spectrum. The method is validated on two types of experimental proteomic data. First, peptide mass fingerprint data is analyzed to explain the unassigned peaks in a full scan mass spectrum. Interestingly, a large numbers of experimental spectra reveals several highly frequent unexplained masses, and pattern mining on these frequent masses demonstrates that subsets of these peaks frequently co-occur. Further evaluation shows that several of these co-occurring peaks indeed have a known common origin, and other patterns are promising hypothesis generators for further analysis. Second, the proposed methodology is validated on tandem mass spectrometral data using a public spectral library, where associations within the mass differences of unassigned peaks and peptide modifications are explored. The investigation of the found patterns illustrates that meaningful patterns can be discovered that can be explained by features of the employed technology and found modifications."}]}

The MTT and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of Celecoxib on proliferation and invasion ability of ovarian cancer cell lines, respectively. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression of epithelial phenotypes, E-cadherin and Keratin, and mesenchymal phenotypes, N-cadherin and Vimentin, as well as p-AKT, p-ERK and ZEB1. ZEB1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of ZEB1 to further inquiring into the downstream of Celecoxib-induced EMT. Cellular morphological assessment revealed that both A2780 and SKOV3 cells gradually appeared in the morphology of mesenchymal cells after Celecoxib treatment. The MTT assay demonstrated that celecoxib had no effect on cell proliferation. Transwell assay showed that Celecoxib significantly increased the cell invasion ability. Western blot data proved that the expression of E-cadherin and keratin was elevated, whereas the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin was decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with the untreated cells, the expression of p-AKT, p-ERK and ZEB1 was also obviously elevated. However, ZEB1 siRNA reversed Celecoxib-induced E-cadherin expression and N-cadherin expression, as well as cellular invasiveness."}]}

To evaluate the effect of CNB on metastasis development, we implanted murine mammary 4T1 tumor cells in BALB/c mice and performed CNB on palpable tumors in half the mice. Subsequently, emulating the human scenario, all mice underwent complete tumor excision and were allowed to recover, with attendant metastasis development. Tumor growth, lung metastasis, circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels, variation in gene expression, composition of the tumor microenvironment, and changes in immunologic markers were compared in biopsied and non-biopsied mice. Mice with biopsied tumors developed significantly more lung metastases compared to non-biopsied mice. Tumors from biopsied mice contained a higher frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accompanied by reduced CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and macrophages, suggesting biopsy-mediated development of an increasingly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

We genotyped SNPs at 19 AMD-associated loci and 6 additional SNPs at the complement factor H (CFH) locus. Phenotyping of all patients was based on fundoscopy, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography. We measured the allele frequencies of 25 AMD-associated SNPs and CFH haplotype frequencies in patients with cCSC and the effect of phenotypic subdivision of cCSC on genetic associations. One SNP in ARMS2 (rs10490924) was significant after Bonferroni correction (Punadjusted=0.002; odds ratio [OR]=0.64). The SNPs at 3 other AMD loci (CFH, TNFRSF10A, ADAMTS9) showed a trend toward association with typical cCSC. Further analysis of the CFH locus identified 2 SNPs that significantly conferred increased risk for cCSC and 1 that was protective. The CFH-H3 haplotype was also found to be protective (P=0.01; OR=0.54). Using multimodal imaging, 197 patients were classified as having typical cCSC, 52 patients had unilateral abnormalities on FA that were otherwise typical of cCSC, and 43 patients had a clinical picture that could be compatible with cCSC, but with features that could also indicate other macular diseases.

Subsequent to this assessment, mice were killed and the brain samples were used to assess the histopathology and messenger RNA expression for EPO and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). We found that infusion of HEK cells/HEK-CM improves cognitive function and alleviates symptoms of depression. Histological assessment demonstrates complete neuroprotection against KA-mediated excitotoxicity, and the hippocampal cytoarchitecture of HEK cells/HEK-CM treated mice was comparable to normal control mice.

We retrospectively compared these phantom results with those of in-house IMRT QA (following the institution's clinical process) for 855 irradiations performed between 2003 and 2013. The sensitivity and specificity of IMRT QA to detect unacceptable or acceptable plans were determined relative to the IROC Houston phantom results. Additional analyses evaluated specific IMRT QA dosimeters and analysis methods. IMRT QA universally showed poor sensitivity relative to the head and neck phantom, that is, poor ability to predict a failing IROC Houston phantom result. Depending on how the IMRT QA results were interpreted, overall sensitivity ranged from 2% to 18%. For different IMRT QA methods, sensitivity ranged from 3% to 54%. Although the observed sensitivity was particularly poor at clinical thresholds (eg 3% dose difference or 90% of pixels passing gamma), receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated that no threshold showed good sensitivity and specificity for the devices evaluated."}]}

Symptoms are commonly added up to sum-scores, and thresholds differentiate between healthy and depressed individuals. The underlying assumption is that all patients diagnosed with MDD have a similar condition, and that sum-scores accurately reflect the severity of this condition. To test this assumption, we examined the number of DSM-5 depression symptom patterns in the \"Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression\" (STAR*D) study. We investigated the number of unique symptom profiles reported by 3703 depressed outpatients at the beginning of the first treatment stage of STAR*D. Overall, we identified 1030 unique symptom profiles. Of these profiles, 864 profiles (83.9%) were endorsed by five or fewer subjects, and 501 profiles (48.6%) were endorsed by only one individual. The most common symptom profile exhibited a frequency of only 1.8%. Controlling for overall depression severity did not reduce the amount of observed heterogeneity."}]}

Liver biopsy specimens from 62 PBC patients (M:F=8:54, age=58 ± 12 years) were evaluated prior to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. Liver biopsies of patients with normal liver (n=11), chronic viral hepatitis (n=36) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n=13) were used as controls. The number of CoH per definite area of hepatic parenchyma (c to p ratio) was calculated in individual cases. We compared the c to p ratios of PBC patients with that of controls and analysed the correlations with histological variables and clinical features. The c to p ratios in PBC patients with mild and extensive fibrosis were lower than those in controls with each degree of fibrosis.

We calculated the power spectral density and synchrony of magnetoencephalography recordings during auditory stimulation in seven tinnitus patients and eight normal-hearing control subjects. Comparisons between subject groups were performed to reveal electrophysiological markers of tinnitus. tVNS-specific effects within each group were studied by comparing recording blocks with and without tVNS. We also investigated the correlation of each measure with individual ratings of tinnitus distress, as measured by the tinnitus handicap inventory questionnaire. Tinnitus patients differed from controls in the baseline condition (no tVNS applied), measured by both cortical oscillatory power and synchronization, particularly at beta and gamma frequencies. Importantly, we found tVNS-induced changes in synchrony, correlating strongly with tinnitus handicap inventory scores, at whole-head beta-band (r = -0.857, p = 0.007), whole-head gamma-band (r = -0.952, p = 0.0003), and frontal gamma-band (r = -0.952, p = 0.0003)."}]}

It was hypothesized that children would differ in their gut microbial structure, as indicated by measures of alpha and beta diversity, based on their temperamental characteristics. Among both boys and girls, greater Surgency/Extraversion was associated greater phylogenetic diversity. In addition, among boys only, subscales loading on this composite scale were associated with differences in phylogenetic diversity, the Shannon Diversity index (SDI), beta diversity, and differences in abundances of Dialister, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Parabacteroides.

GTS-21, a selective agonist of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, has been indicated to exert neuroprotective effects in the experimental animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that pretreatment with GTS-21 attenuates isoflurane-induced cognitive decline in aged rats. In the present study, 20-mo-old rats were administered GTS-21 or an equal volume of saline by intraperitoneal injection 30 min before exposure to isoflurane. Then the rats were exposed to 1.3% isoflurane for 4 h. Spatial learning and memory of the rats were assessed at 2 wk after isoflurane exposure. The expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Simultaneously, neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus was also observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and Nissl staining. We found that exposure to isoflurane induces learning and memory deficits of old rats. IL-1β in the hippocampus was increased at 4 h after isoflurane exposure. Isoflurane also increased neuroapoptosis in the hippocampus and decreased neuronal density in the CA1 region. And GTS-21 pretreatment effectively alleviated these changes."}]}
{"query": "Does honokiol affect melanoma cell growth by targeting the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway?", "topk": [{"text": "Malignant melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with limited effective therapeutic options. Melanoma research concentrates on maximizing the effect on cancer cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and has been shown to control tumor progression regulating the cell cycle, protein synthesis, and cell growth and/or survival. Honokiol (HNK) is a biphenolic compound derived from Magnolia officinalis, a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for the treatment of various pathological conditions. Recent studies have shown that HNK has antitumor activity with relatively low toxicity. In this study, we demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of HNK on melanoma and melanoma cancer stem cells were mediated through the activation of AMPK and hence AMPK signaling in melanoma cells. We determined the effects of HNK treatment on various melanoma cell lines. HNK-induced cell growth inhibitory effects were determined using hexosaminidase assay. Protein expression studies were done by immunoblotting. Primary spheroid assay was used to assess stemness by growing single suspension cells in ultralow attachment plates. HNK is highly effective in inhibiting melanoma cells by attenuating protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and AMPK signaling. HNK showed significant inhibition of the spheroid-forming capacity of melanoma cells and, hence, stemness. HNK significantly decreased the number and size of melanospheres in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analyses showed enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK in melanoma cells. Furthermore, HNK decreased the cellular adenosine triphosphate pool in a dose-dependent manner with maximum effects observed at 48 hours."}]}

On TCD, peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocities in both middle cerebral and basilar arteries were manually measured to calculate pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI). Increased resistance was defined as PI equal to 1.2 or more and RI equal to .75 or more.

We included 105 children, with mean age 14.4 years (range 10-16), under observation or treatment for idiopathic scoliosis, and 103 children from an age-matched population-based cohort. COMP was measured in serum at the time of inclusion. Growth velocity was estimated from repeated height measurements. T tests, analysis of covariance or linear regression were used for statistical comparisons. COMP was mean (SD) 11 (5) units/liter (U/L) in children with scoliosis and 13 (5) U/L in the control cohort (p = 0.005, adjusted for sex and sampling time of the day). When patients and controls were analyzed together, high COMP was correlated with high growth velocity (β = 0.19, p = 0.003). When patients and controls were analyzed separately, COMP was correlated with growth velocity in children with scoliosis (β = 0.27, p = 0.007), but not in children without scoliosis (β = 0.02, p = 0.83) (all analyses adjusted for age, sex and sampling time).

In this study we used the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score to predict the incidence of AKI in CCU patients who had not undergone coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) after a cardiac angiogram. The study cohort comprised 126 patients diagnosed with 2 or 3 coronary vessels disease who did not receive CABG during their hospital course. This study was performed in the CCU of a tertiary referral university hospital between September 2012 and August 2013. The STS score was evaluated with adjustment in all patients and the outcomes of the risk of mortality, morbidity, or mortality and renal failure were selected for predicting assessment. Furthermore, the performance of the STS scores was compared with that of other scoring systems. A total of 28.5% (36 of 126) of the patients had AKI of varying severity. For predicting AKI, the STS renal failure score was excellent, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.851 ± 0.039, p < 0.001. When compared with other scoring systems, the STS renal failure score demonstrated the highest discriminatory power, the most favorable Youden index, and the highest overall correctness of prediction."}]}

PDU findings were retrospectively analyzed in 100 men during flaccid state. Nine men had SP (age range 20-40 years), 4 had Peyronie's disease (PD) (35-48 years), 67 men had erectile dysfunction (16-67 years), and 20 men had normal erectile function (18-42 years). The variables measured were peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities, and the Doppler velocity waveform. Values in men with SP were compared with those in the other groups. Median systolic and diastolic velocity was significantly higher in men with SP (systolic/diastolic velocity was 26/4 cm/second in men with SP vs. 13/0 cm/second, 14/0 cm/second, and 16/0 cm/second in men with PD, ED, and normal erectile function, respectively; P=0.0001). Men with SP had a characteristic low peripheral resistance (PR) waveform with fluctuating velocities; the diastolic velocity was consistently positive (2-7 cm/second) and fluctuated between +2 and +8 cm/second.

Diabetes was induced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) in Wistar male rats (250-300 g). After 8 weeks, the hearts of control and diabetic animals were isolated and mounted on a constant-pressure Langendorff apparatus. All hearts were subjected to 30 min regional ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion (by occluding and re-opening of LAD coronary artery, respectively). At the end of ischemia, the hearts received IPostC, cyclosporine-A, or both or none of them. Myocardial creatine-kinase (CK) release as an index of tissue injury was measured spectrophotometery in coronary effluent in reperfusion phase. Infarct size was identified by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), LV systolic pressure (LVSP), rate-pressure product (RPP) and coronary flow were recorded throughout the experiment. IPostC, applied at the onset of reperfusion, failed to improve myocardial LVEDP and RPP, or reduce tissue damage indicated by infarct size and CK release in diabetic hearts, while it significantly recovered these parameters toward the pre-ischemic values in control hearts (P < 0.05). In contrast, with simultaneous inhibition of mPTP using cyclosporine-A, the cardioprotective effects of IPostC on myocardial hemodynamics, infarct size and CK release were significantly restored in diabetic hearts (P < 0.05)."}]}

Hospital records were reviewed of 16 children with neuropathic bladders due to myelomeningocele, and who had botulinum toxin A injections between 2007 and 2010. Botulinum toxin A (10 units/kg) was injected endoscopically into various sites of the detrusor, except the trigone. The success was defined as complete dryness between clean intermittent catheterizations. Urodynamic studies before and after the application were evaluated and parameters, including bladder capacity (measured/expected) and compliance, were also analyzed. Reviewing the results, patients were then classified into two groups: as having fibrotic bladders (noncompliant, acontractile bladders with high pressures) or overactive bladders. Urodynamic findings and therapy success were then compared between the groups. A total of 19 injections, including repeat injections in three patients, were performed. Results of the 16 initial injections were evaluated. Nine patients had detrusor overactivity, and five out of nine (56%) applications in this group resulted in complete dryness between clean intermittent catheterizations. In bladders with typical detrusor overactivity, there was a significant increase in both the capacity (from 0.53 to 0.74) and compliance (from 4.7 to 8.6 ml/cm H2O). Looking at the seven patients that displayed fibrotic bladders with very low compliance and no contraction at all, none of them presented with notable clinical improvement from injections. Comparing the urodynamic findings, there was no significant difference in compliance (3.1 ml/cm H2O before and 3.5 ml/cm H2O after) and bladder capacity (0.58 before and 0.52 after the treatment) in the fibrotic bladders."}]}

We longitudinally investigated the altered expression of CD100, its receptor CD72, and other activation markers CD69 and CD86 on B cells in 20 chronic HCV-infected patients before and after treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha (Peg-IFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) by flow cytometry. The frequency of CD5+ B cells as well as the expression levels of CD100, CD69 and CD86 was significantly increased in chronic HCV patients and returned to normal in patients with sustained virological response after discontinuation of IFN-α/RBV therapy. Upon IFN-α treatment, CD100 expression on B cells and the two subsets was further up-regulated in patients who achieved early virological response, and this was confirmed by in vitro experiments. Moreover, the increased CD100 expression via IFN-α was inversely correlated with the decline of the HCV-RNA titer during early-phase treatment."}]}

We have previously determined that cells from APL patients show increased expression of genes regulated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) compared to normal promyelocytes. HIFs regulate crucial aspects of solid tumor progression and are currently being implicated in leukemogenesis. To investigate the contribution of hypoxia-related signaling in APL compared to other AML sub-types, we reverse engineered a transcriptional network from gene expression profiles of AML patients' samples, starting from a list of direct target genes of HIF-1. A HIF-1-dependent subnetwork of genes specifically dysregulated in APL was derived from the comparison between APL and other AMLs. Interestingly, this subnetwork shows a unique involvement of genes related to extracellular matrix interaction and cell migration, with decreased expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and increased expression of genes implicated in motility and invasion, thus unveiling the presence of characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We observed that the genes of this subnetwork, whose dysregulation shows a peculiar pattern across different AML sub-types, distinguish malignant from normal promyelocytes, thus ruling out dependence on a myeloid developmental stage. Also, expression of these genes is reversed upon treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells with all-trans retinoic acid and cell differentiation."}]}

These estimators are applied to data reported in a French primary care surveillance system based on voluntary GPs (the Sentinelles network) for comparison. Depending on hypotheses for weight computations, relative changes in weekly national-level incidence estimates up to 3% for influenza, 6% for diarrhea, and 11% for varicella were observed. The use of consultation-weighted estimates led to bias reduction in the estimates. At the regional level (NUTS2 level - Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units Level 2), relative changes were even larger between incidence estimates, with changes between -40% and +55%. Using bias-reduced weights decreased variation in incidence between regions and increased spatial autocorrelation."}]}

In this study, we attempted to clarify whether a similar system exists in the other neuronal cell model, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. After confirming that high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 100-250 μM) initiate PC12 cell death, we analyzed growth factor expressional changes after H2O2 treatment. We found, intriguingly, that gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not PGRN was significantly induced by H2O2. Although little expression of the high affinity BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase TrkB was observed in PC12 cells, expression of low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, was clearly observed. This BDNF signaling appeared to contribute to PC12 cell protection, since PC12 cell death was significantly attenuated by BDNF treatment."}]}

HbA1c trajectories differed markedly across age groups, with older patients experiencing greater deterioration than their younger counterparts (p<0.001). HbA1c trajectories, stratified by age, varied markedly by race (p for race×diagnostic age <0.001). Non-Hispanic African-American patients experienced higher initial HbA1c (8.7% vs 7.6% (71.6 vs 59.6 mmol/mol); p<0.001), and greater deterioration in HbA1c than non-Hispanic Caucasian patients across diagnostic ages (rise of 2.04% vs 0.99% per year (22.3 vs 10.8 mmol/mol/year); p<0.0001)."}]}

A better understanding of this heterogeneity may reveal important disease mechanisms underlying the malignancy of AD. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between AD pathologies and early death in AD caused by dementia. At a memory clinic, 247 referred consecutive patients with AD were monitored during 12.6 ± 1.6 years. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed with baseline measures of amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology (APOE genotype, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42) tau pathology (CSF phosphorylated tau and total tau), cerebrovascular pathology (white-matter lesions and CSF/serum albumin ratio), neuroinflammatory pathology (CSF soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, sVCAM-1), frontal, temporal, and central brain atrophies, global cognition, sex, and age. Comorbidities and medications also were analyzed. All continuous variables were transformed to z scores to compare hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). At follow-up, 89% of the patients had died. The mean survival time was 6.4 ± 3.0 years. The AD pathology that independently predicted an early death caused by dementia was cerebral inflammation (sVCAM-1; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.64). Other independent predictors were lower global cognition (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61), frontal atrophy (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70), and medial temporal atrophy (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.49). When examining death caused by dementia and related causes (vascular diseases and infections), age (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46) and cerebrovascular pathology (white-matter lesions: HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.36; and CSF/serum albumin ratio: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.001-1.34) were also significant risk factors in addition to the previous variables.

{"query": "Is mitochondria inheritance a key factor for tolerance to dehydration in wine yeast production?", "topk": [{"text": "Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouse when organisms are grown in the presence of oxygen. They are also the source of reactive oxygen species that cause damage to the biochemical components of the cell and lead to cellular ageing and death. Under winemaking conditions, Saccharomyces yeasts exclusively have a fermentative metabolism due to the high sugar content of grape must. However, their production as an active dry yeast (ADY) form required aerobic propagation and a dehydration process. In these industrial steps, oxidative stress is particularly harmful for the cell. In this work, we analysed the impact of the mitochondrial genome on oxidative stress response, longevity and dehydration tolerance using the synthetic interspecific hybrids obtained between two S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum strains. The isogenic nature of nuclear DNA of such hybrids allowed us to analyse the impact of mitochondrial DNA for fermentative and oxidative stress conditions. Under grape must conditions, the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA poorly impacted the fermentative performance of interspecific hybrids, unlike the hybrids with S. cerevisiae mitochondrial inheritance, which displayed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and dehydration, and showed an extended chronological longevity when cells were grown with aeration."}]}

Functional parameter reproducibility and analysis of sensitivity to imaging resolution and arterial input function were evaluated in image sets acquired from a 320-slice CT with a controlled flow phantom and patients with brain metastases, whose treatments were planned for stereotactic radiation surgery and who consented to a research ethics board-approved prospective imaging biomarker study. A voxel-based temporal dynamic analysis (TDA) methodology was used at baseline, at day 7, and at day 20 after treatment. The ability to detect changes in kinetic parameter maps in clinical data sets was investigated for both 4D TDA and conventional 2D ROI-based analysis methods. A total of 7 brain metastases in 3 patients were evaluated over the 3 time points. The 4D TDA method showed improved spatial efficacy and accuracy of perfusion parameters compared to ROI-based DCE analysis (P<.005), with a reproducibility error of less than 2% when tested with DCE phantom data. Clinically, changes in transfer constant from the blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space (Ktrans) were seen when using TDA, with substantially smaller errors than the 2D method on both day 7 post radiation surgery (±13%; P<.05) and by day 20 (±12%; P<.04). Standard methods showed a decrease in Ktrans but with large uncertainty (111.6 ± 150.5) %."}]}

One known reason for this is an access barrier to obtaining healthcare visits; however, little is known about whether insurance status is associated with differential rates of receipt of diabetes care during visits. To examine the association between health insurance and receipt of diabetes preventive care during an office visit. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record and Medicaid data from 38 Oregon community health centers. Logistic regression was used to test the association between insurance and receipt of four diabetes services during an office visit among patients who were continuously uninsured (n=1,117); continuously insured (n=1,466); and discontinuously insured (n=336) in 2006-2007. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for within-patient correlation. Data were analyzed in 2013. Overall, continuously uninsured patients had lower odds of receiving services at visits when due, compared to those who were continuously insured (AOR=0.73, 95% CI=0.66, 0.80).

Linear-no-threshold (LNT) models are widely used to estimate risks associated with low-dose exposures. However, the low-dose hyperradiosensitivity (HRS) phenomenon, in which cells are especially sensitive at low doses but then show increased radioresistance at higher doses, provides evidence of nonlinearity in the low-dose region. HRS is more prominent in the G2 phase of the cell cycle than in the G0/G1 or S phases. Here we provide the first cytogenetic mechanistic evidence of low-dose HRS in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using structural chromosomal aberrations. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes from 2 normal healthy female donors were acutely exposed to cobalt 60 γ rays in either G0 or G2 using closely spaced doses ranging from 0 to 1.5 Gy. Structural chromosomal aberrations were enumerated, and the slopes of the regression lines at low doses (0-0.4 Gy) were compared with doses of 0.5 Gy and above. HRS was clearly evident in both donors for cells irradiated in G2. No HRS was observed in cells irradiated in G0. The radiation effect per unit dose was 2.5- to 3.5-fold higher for doses ≤0.4 Gy than for doses >0.5 Gy."}]}

Hypobetalipoproteinemia was present in two DCCT subjects, IDs 1427 and 1078, whose LDL-C levels were 36 and 28 mg/dL, respectively, and triglyceride levels were 20 and 28 mg/dL, respectively. We performed exome sequencing on genomic DNA from the two patients with hypobetalipoproteinemia. The subjects 1427 and 1078 had heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and these mutations resulted in premature stop codons at amino acid 1333 (ApoB-29) and 3680 (ApoB-81), respectively. Indeed, the plasma ApoB level of subject 1427 (19 mg/dL) was the lowest and that of subject 1078 (26 mg/dL) was the second to the lowest among all the 1,441 DCCT participants.

{"query": "Does percent reduction of growth hormone levels correlate closely with percent resected tumor volume in acromegaly?", "topk": [{"text": "Correlation between tumor volume and hormone levels in individual patients would permit calculation of the fraction of tumor removed by surgery, by measuring postoperative hormone levels. The goals of this study were to examine the relationship between tumor volume, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, and to assess the correlation between percent tumor removal and the reduction in plasma GH and IGF-1 in patients with acromegaly. The 3D region of interest-based volumetric method was used to measure tumor volume via MRI before and after surgery in 11 patients with GH-secreting adenomas. The volume of residual tumor as a fraction of preoperative tumor volume was correlated with GH levels before and after surgery. Examination of this potential correlation required selection of patients with acromegaly who 1) had incomplete tumor removal, 2) had precise measurements of initial and residual tumor, and 3) were not on medical therapy. Densely granulated tumors produced more peripheral GH per mass of tumor than sparsely granulated tumors (p = 0.04). There was a correlation between GH and IGF-1 levels (p = 0.001). Although there was no close correlation between tumor size and peripheral GH levels, after normalizing each tumor to its own plasma GH level and tumor volume, a comparison of percent tumor resection with percent drop in plasma GH yielded a high correlation coefficient (p = 0.006)."}]}
{"query": "Does stochastic modeling suggest that noise reduces differentiation efficiency by inducing a heterogeneous drug response in glioma differentiation therapy?", "topk": [{"text": "Glioma differentiation therapy is a novel strategy that has been used to induce glioma cells to differentiate into glia-like cells. Although some advances in experimental methods for exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in differentiation therapy have been made, a model-based comprehensive analysis is still needed to understand these differentiation mechanisms and improve the effects of anti-cancer therapeutics. This type of analysis becomes necessary in stochastic cases for two main reasons: stochastic noise inherently exists in signal transduction and phenotypic regulation during targeted therapy and chemotherapy, and the relationship between this noise and drug efficacy in differentiation therapy is largely unknown. In this study, we developed both an additive noise model and a Chemical-Langenvin-Equation model for the signaling pathways involved in glioma differentiation therapy to investigate the functional role of noise in the drug response. Our model analysis revealed an ultrasensitive mechanism of cyclin D1 degradation that controls the glioma differentiation induced by the cAMP inducer cholera toxin (CT). The role of cyclin D1 degradation in human glioblastoma cell differentiation was then experimentally verified. Our stochastic simulation demonstrated that noise not only renders some glioma cells insensitive to cyclin D1 degradation during drug treatment but also induce heterogeneous differentiation responses among individual glioma cells by modulating the ultrasensitive response of cyclin D1. As such, the noise can reduce the differentiation efficiency in drug-treated glioma cells, which was verified by the decreased evolution of differentiation potential, which quantified the impact of noise on the dynamics of the drug-treated glioma cell population."}]}

We hypothesized that small group learning with intensive peer interaction, using buzz-groups followed by plenary discussion, would motivate students to prepare seminar assignments at home and to actively engage in the seminars. Active engagement involved discussion of the preparatory assignments until consensus was reached. In total seven seminars were scheduled in a 10-week physiology course of an undergraduate Biomedical Sciences program. After each seminar, students were asked to fill out their perceptions of preparation and quality of the seminar (deepening of knowledge and confidence in answers) on a five-point scale using electronic questionnaires. Student motives were first collected using open questions. In the final questionnaire students were asked to indicate on a five-point scale how each motive was perceived. Students overall explanations why they had learned from seminars were collected via open questions in the final questionnaire. One hundred and twenty-four students of the cohort from November 2012 to February 2013 (82.6 %) voluntarily participated. Students' motives to prepare and attend seminars were analyzed by inspection of descriptive statistics. Linear regression analysis was conducted to relate student preparation to the quality of seminars, seminar attendance to exam scores, and exam scores to the quality of seminars. Answers to open questions were deductively clustered. Studying the material, training for exams and comparing answers with peers motivated students to prepare the seminars. Students were motivated to participate actively because they wanted to keep track of correct answers themselves, to better understand the content and to be able to present their findings in plenary discussions. Perceived preparation of peers was positively associated with the perceived quality of seminars. Also, seminar attendance was positively associated with exam scores. Students' overall explanations suggest that discussing with peers and applying knowledge in pathophysiology cases underlies this association."}]}

We hypothesized that high circulating levels of HBP are associated with severity of post-cardiac arrest syndrome and poor outcome. Plasma was obtained from 278 patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter observational study in 21 intensive care units (ICU) in Finland. HBP was assayed at ICU admission and 48 h later. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was defined as the 24 h Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 12. ICU death and 12-month Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) were evaluated. Multiple linear and logistic regression tests and receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) were performed. Eighty-two percent of patients (229 of 278) survived to ICU discharge and 48 % (133 of 276) to 1 year with a favorable neurological outcome (CPC 1 or 2).

In both the ancestral and the derived populations, the predominant characteristic of the cold shock response is the swift and massive upregulation of heat shock proteins and other chaperones. Although we find ~25 % of the genome to be differentially expressed following a cold shock, only relatively few genes (n = 16) are up- or down-regulated in a population-specific way.

Using the tracer-based approach, we assessed the contribution of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) vs. pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity in the derivation of Krebs cycle intermediates. Our data show that PC activity is indeed high in K562 cells. We also demonstrate a branched entry to the Krebs cycle of K562 cells with one branch running counterclockwise using PC-derived oxaloacetate and the other clockwise from the PDH activity. Finally, we show that the PC activity of K562 cells exclusively fuels the ROS-induced decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to malonate in response to BaP treatment; resulting in further Krebs cycle disruption via depletion of oxaloacetate and malonate-mediated inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) resulting in a twofold reduction of fumarate."}]}

{"query": "Does miR-221 mediate Chemoresistance of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma by Direct Targeting of DKK2 Expression?", "topk": [{"text": "Chemoresistance is a main obstacle to effective esophageal cancer (EC) therapy. We hypothesize that altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in EC cancer progression and resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapeutic strategies. Four pairs of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cell lines and corresponding 5-FU resistant variants were established. The expression levels of miRNAs previously shown to be involved in the general regulation of stem cell pathways were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The effects of selected miRNAs on proliferation, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We identified a particular miRNA and analyzed its putative target genes in 14 pairs of human EC tumor specimens with surrounding normal tissue by qRT-PCR as well as Wnt pathway associated genes by immunohistochemistry in another 45 EAC tumor samples. MiR-221 was overexpressed in 5-FU resistant EC cell lines as well as in human EAC tissue. DKK2 was identified as a target gene for miR-221. Knockdown of miR-221 in 5-FU resistant cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, restored chemosensitivity, and led to inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway mediated by alteration in DKK2 expression. Moreover, miR-221 reduction resulted in alteration of EMT-associated genes such as E-cadherin and vimentin as well as significantly slower xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. RT profiler analysis identified a substantial dysregulation of 4 Wnt/β-catenin signaling and chemoresistance target genes as a result of miR-221 modulation: CDH1, CD44, MYC, and ABCG2."}]}

Thus, current therapy options are not satisfactory. PKI-587 is a highly potent novel dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTORC1/C2. We assessed the effects of PKI-587 in different GEP-NEN tumor models, including poorly differentiated cell line LCC-18, compared with the established mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus. We treated the cell lines BON, QGP1, KRJ-I and LCC-18 with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor PKI-587, and compared with everolimus and DMSO. We assessed the impact of treatments on viability (WST-1 assay), on apoptotic processes (Caspase 3/7 assay, JC-1) and on cell cycle regulation (flow cytometry). We determined alterations of signaling mediators by phosphor-specific western blot analysis and conducted multiplexed gene expression analysis (nCounter® technology). In all cell lines, PKI-587 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation whereas everolimus was less effective. Treatment with PKI-587 led to cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and successfully suppressed activity of direct mTORC1 target 4E-BP1, a crucial factor for tumor genesis only partially inhibited by everolimus. Gene expression analyses revealed relevant changes of RAS, MAPK, STAT and PI3K pathway genes after treatment. Treatment dependent and cell line characteristic effects on AKT/RB/E2F signaling regarding cell cycle control and apoptosis are extensively discussed in this article."}]}

We aimed to analyze the implications of using NT-proBNP alone, echocardiographic parameters alone, or a combination of both for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcome. Within the longitudinal Cardiovascular and Renal Outcome in CKD 2-4 Patients-The Fourth Homburg Evaluation Study, we prospectively studied 496 patients with CKD stages G2-G4, in whom we measured NT-proBNP. Left ventricular mass index, left atrial volume index, diastolic left ventricular function, and systolic left ventricular function were assessed echocardiographically. During 4.5±2.0 years of follow-up, the occurrence of (1) decompensated heart failure or all-cause mortality and (2) atherosclerotic events or all-cause mortality was recorded. We assessed the association of NT-proBNP and echocardiographic parameters with outcome (using Cox models) and evaluated the increased discriminative value associated with the addition of echocardiographic parameters and NT-proBNP (using integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement). During follow-up, 104 patients suffered decompensated heart failure or all-cause mortality, and 127 patents had atherosclerotic events or all-cause mortality. In univariable analyses, NT-proBNP and echocardiographic parameters predicted cardiovascular events. NT-proBNP remained an independent predictor for both end points in multivariate analysis, whereas left ventricular mass index, left atrial volume index, and diastolic left ventricular function did not. The addition of NT-proBNP on top of clinical and various echocardiographic variables was associated with improvements in reclassification for decompensated heart failure or all-cause mortality (integrated discrimination improvement =6.5%-8.3%; net reclassification improvement =23.1%-27.0%; all P≤0.03).

Recent evidence suggests the existence of GC-insensitive pathways in airway smooth muscle (ASM) caused by a defect in GC receptor (GRα) function. We examined whether other mechanisms could potentially explain the reduced sensitivity of ASM cells to GC in severe asthmatics. Airway smooth muscle cells from healthy and severe asthmatic subjects were treated with TNF-α and responses to corticosteroids in both cohorts were compared by ELISA, immunoblot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry assays were used to assess the expression of the protein phosphatase PP5 in endobronchial biopsies and ASM cells. The production of CCL11 and CCL5 by TNF-α was insensitive to both fluticasone and dexamethasone in ASM cells from severe asthmatic compared to that in healthy subjects. Fluticasone-induced GRα nuclear translocation, phosphorylation at serine 211 and expression of GC-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) were significantly reduced in ASM cells from severe asthmatics compared to responses in healthy subjects. Levels of PP5 were increased in ASM cells from severe asthmatics and PP5 knockdown using siRNA restored fluticasone repressive action on chemokine production and its ability to induce GRα nuclear translocation and GRE-dependent GILZ expression.

Recently, several studies have shown that MSCs can be easily isolated from human amnion. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of transplantation of human amnion-derived MSCs (hAMSCs) in rats with liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL/kg of 50% carbon tetrachloride twice a week for 6 weeks. At 3 weeks, hAMSCs (1 × 10(6) cells) were transplanted intravenously. Rats were sacrificed at 7 weeks, and histological analyses and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hAMSCs on the activation of Kupffer cells. Transplantation of hAMSCs significantly reduced the fibrotic area, deposition of type-I collagen, the number of α-smooth muscle actin-positive hepatic stellate cells, and CD68-positive Kupffer cells in the livers. messenger RNA expression of α-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was significantly decreased and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and hepatocyte growth factor was significantly increased in the liver of hAMSC-treated rats. Transplantation of hAMSCs at 3 weeks plus 5 weeks did not have an additive effect. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Kupffer cell activation induced by lipopolysaccharide was significantly decreased by culturing with conditioned medium obtained from hAMSCs."}]}

We developed a novel nonerythropoiesis cyclic helix B peptide (CHBP) derived from erythropoietin, which has potent tissue protection and prolonged serum stability. The renoprotection and potential mechanism of CHBP were evaluated in a kidney preservation model. Porcine kidneys (n = 5) subjected to 20-minute warm ischemia were retrieved and flushed with hyperosmolar citrate to mimic deceased donation. The kidneys and autologous blood ± 10.56 nmol/L CHBP were placed in cold storage (CS) for 18 hours. These kidneys were then normothermically hemoreperfused for 3 hours using an isolated organ perfusion system. The renal function and structure, apoptosis, inflammation, and expression of caspase-3 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were assessed. Cyclic helix B peptide significantly increased the renal blood flow, oxygen consumption, and urine output during reperfusion, but decreased serum potassium and renal tissue damage. Apoptotic cells were significantly decreased in the tubular areas, but increased in the lumens and interstitial areas in the post-CS and postreperfused kidneys, whereas myeloperoxidase+ cells were reduced. In addition, the expression of both caspase-3 precursor and active subunits was downregulated by CHBP in reperfused kidneys. However, HSP70 was upregulated in the post-CS and postreperfused kidneys treated with CHBP."}]}

The incidence, health service utilisation and household expenditure related to rotavirus gastroenteritis according to national income quintiles were obtained from local data sources. Multiple birth cohorts were distributed into income quintiles and followed from birth over the first five years of life in a multicohort, static model. We found that the rich pay more out of pocket (OOP) than the poor, as the rich use more expensive private care. OOP payments among the poorest although small are high as a proportion of household income. Rotavirus vaccination results in substantial reduction in rotavirus episodes and expenditure and provides financial risk protection to all income groups.

In 1993, 2366 study participants, 41, 51, 61, and 71 years old, had traditional cardiovascular risk factors and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) measured. Risk groups were identified based on known CVD and components of metabolic syndrome, Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation, or Framingham risk score.

The postmetoclopramide lateralization index was accurate in identifying APA, but did not increase diagnostic accuracy over baseline lateralization index, because the RASI increased similarly in both sides. Conversely, metoclopramide raised RASI to values more than 0.90 bilaterally in non-APA patients allowing accurate identification of factitious aldosterone suppression. In contrast, RASI was 0.90 or less in 48% contralateral to the tumor in APA patients. Regression analysis showed the APA patients with persistent suppression of RASI contralaterally showed a more florid primary aldosteronism phenotype."}]}

We retrospectively analyzed the intra-aneurysmal flow by evaluating the in-flow and out-flow delays on preoperative, immediate postoperative, 24-hour and 12-month follow-up angiography. Dichotomy of in-flow and out-flow within the aneurysm was considered as the time of contrast filling and time of contrast washing relatively to the parent artery. The delay times were compared and correlated with the therapeutic success of FDS at 12 months of follow-up. Out of 14 treated IAs, in 13 consecutive patients, n = 10 (71%) aneurysms showed complete occlusion at 12 months. Between immediate postoperative and 24-hour control, 10 aneurysms (71%) demonstrated in-flow modification, with eight increasing, two decreasing and four having no change.

Recent research has shown that neuronal and vascular damage are closely related in retinal disease. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a well-studied neurotrophic factor that is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases and macular telangiectasia. However, little is known about its effect on retinal vasculature. In this study, we investigate the effects of CNTF in retinal neovascular disease using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Newborn pups were exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day (P)7 to P12 and subsequently returned to room air. Ciliary neurotrophic factor was injected intravitreally at OIR P12 and the vaso-obliterated and neovascular areas were quantified at OIR P17. Immunohistochemistry, RNA, and protein analysis were used to identify CNTF-responsive cells. In vitro experiments were performed to analyze the effect of CNTF on endothelial and astroglial cells. In the OIR model, CNTF facilitated capillary regrowth and attenuated preretinal neovascularization in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effect of CNTF was mediated via activation of the JAK/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical studies identified endothelial cells among others as CNTF-responsive cells in the retina. In vitro studies confirmed the anti-angiogenic effect of CNTF on endothelial cell sprouting."}]}

In this study, we investigated the effect of IL-22 on the survival of RA-FLS from RA patients and examined the possible mechanism to determine new therapeutic strategies for RA. FLS obtained from patients with RA were cultured in vitro and treated with sodium nitroprussiate (SNP) to induce apoptosis in the presence or absence of IL-22. RA-FLS viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RA-FLS apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining (AV/PI). The levels of IL-22R1, pSTAT3-Y705, pSTAT3-S727, total STAT3, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blot analysis. IL-22R1 was expressed on RA-FLS. IL-22 pretreatment at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 ng/mL increased RA-FLS viability and prevented SNP-induced apoptosis. Treatment with the STAT3 inhibitors, HO3867 or STA21, reversed the protective effect of IL-22 on SNP-induced apoptosis of RA-FLS. IL-22-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3-Y705 and pSTAT3-S727) was increased in RA-FLS.

Several factors are known to influence the strength of these press-fit modular connections. However, the influence of different head sizes has not previously been investigated. The aim of the study was to establish whether the choice of head size influences the initial strength of the trunnion-head connection. Ti-6Al-4V trunnions (n = 60) and two different sizes of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) heads (28 mm and 36 mm; 30 of each size) were used in the study. Three different levels of assembly force were considered: 4 kN; 5 kN; and 6 kN (n = 10 each). The strength of the press-fit connection was subsequently evaluated by measuring the pull-off force required to break the connection. The statistical differences in pull-off force were examined using a Kruskal-Wallis test and two-sample Mann-Whitney U test. Finite element and analytical models were developed to understand the reasons for the experimentally observed differences. 36 mm diameter heads had significantly lower pull-off forces than 28 mm heads when impacted at 4 kN and 5 kN (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), but not at 6 kN (p = 0.21). Mean pull-off forces at 4 kN and 5 kN impaction forces were approximately 20% larger for 28 mm heads compared with 36 mm heads. Finite element and analytical models demonstrate that the differences in pull-off strength can be explained by differences in structural rigidity and the resulting interface pressures."}]}

{"query": "Do erythrocytes activate purified and platelet soluble guanylate cyclases even in conditions favourable for NO synthesis?", "topk": [{"text": "Direct interaction between Red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets is known for a long time. The bleeding time is prolonged in anemic patients independent of their platelet count and could be corrected by transfusion of RBCs, which indicates that RBCs play an important role in hemostasis and platelet activation. However, in the last few years, opposing mechanisms of platelet inhibition by RBCs derived nitric oxide (NO) were proposed. The aim of our study was to identify whether RBCs could produce NO and activate soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in platelets. To test whether RBCs could activate sGC under different conditions (whole blood, under hypoxia, or even loaded with NO), we used our well-established and highly sensitive models of NO-dependent sGC activation in platelets and activation of purified sGC. The activation of sGC was monitored by detecting the phosphorylation of Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP(S239)) by flow cytometry and Western blot. ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test and Student's t-test were used as appropriate. We show that in the whole blood, RBCs prevent NO-mediated inhibition of ADP and TRAP6-induced platelet activation. Likewise, coincubation of RBCs with platelets results in strong inhibition of NO-induced sGC activation. Under hypoxic conditions, incubation of RBCs with NO donor leads to Hb-NO formation which inhibits sGC activation in platelets. Similarly, RBCs inhibit activation of purified sGC, even under conditions optimal for RBC-mediated generation of NO from nitrite."}]}

Previously, it has been shown that the density of μ-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell is higher in alcohol-preferring Alko Alcohol (AA) rats than in alcohol-avoiding Alko Non-Alcohol rats. In addition, EtOH releases opioid peptides in the nucleus accumbens and opioid receptor antagonists are able to modify EtOH intake, all suggesting an opioidergic mechanism in the control of EtOH consumption. As the exact mechanisms of opioidergic involvement remains to be elucidated, the aim of this study was to clarify the role of accumbal μ- and κ-opioid receptors in controlling EtOH intake in alcohol-preferring AA rats. Microinfusions of the μ-opioid receptor antagonist CTOP (0.3 and 1 μg/site), μ-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO (0.03 and 0.1 μg/site), nonselective opioid receptor agonist morphine (30 μg/site), and κ-opioid receptor agonist U50488H (0.3 and 1 μg/site) were administered via bilateral guide cannulas into the nucleus accumbens shell of AA rats that voluntarily consumed 10% EtOH solution in an intermittent, time-restricted (90-minute) 2-bottle choice access paradigm. CTOP (1 μg/site) significantly increased EtOH intake. Conversely, DAMGO resulted in a decreasing trend in EtOH intake. Neither morphine nor U50488H had any effect on EtOH intake in the used paradigm."}]}
{"query": "Does the Activity of Antimicrobial Surfaces vary by Testing Protocol Utilized?", "topk": [{"text": "Contaminated hospital surfaces are an important source of nosocomial infections. A major obstacle in marketing antimicrobial surfaces is a lack of efficacy data based on standardized testing protocols. We compared the efficacy of multiple testing protocols against several \"antimicrobial\" film surfaces. Four clinical isolates were used: one Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Two industry methods (modified ISO 22196 and ASTM E2149), a \"dried droplet\", and a \"transfer\" method were tested against two commercially available antimicrobial films, one film in development, an untreated control, and a positive (silver) control film. At 2 (only ISO) and 24 hours following inoculation, bacteria were collected from film surfaces and enumerated. Compared to untreated films in all protocols, there were no significant differences in recovery on either commercial brand at 2 or 24 hours after inoculation. The silver surface demonstrated significant microbicidal activity (mean loss 4.9 Log10 CFU/ml) in all methods and time points with the exception of 2 hours in the ISO protocol and the transfer method. Using our novel droplet method, no differences between placebo and active surfaces were detected. The surface in development demonstrated variable activity depending on method, organism, and time point. The ISO demonstrated minimal activity at 2 hours but significant activity at 24 hours (mean 4.5 Log10 CFU/ml difference versus placebo). The ASTEM protocol exhibited significant differences in recovery of staphylococci (mean 5 Log10 CFU/ml) but not Gram-negative isolates (10 fold decrease).

From January 2002 through December 2010, 161 patients underwent PD and were enrolled in this study. Patient demographics, surgical factors, and clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated to examine the factors predictive of cholangitis after PD and confirm the usefulness of hepaticoplasty. Cholangitis after PD occurred in 13 patients (8.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the ratio of the postoperative bile duct diameter to that before surgery was the only independent risk factor for cholangitis after PD (p = 0.0012). In the small bile duct group, in which the diameter was ≤15 mm before surgery (n = 99), hepaticoplasty reduced the narrowing of the bile duct after PD, and no cholangitis occurred.

Biochemical approaches have indicated that the putative host cell ligand(s) for BslA is a surface protein, which is independent of the sugar components for binding to Bs1A. A ligand screening using blot overlays, far Western blots and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that BslA binds to mammalian laminin. ELISA based solid-phase binding assays and surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that there were high affinity interactions between BslA(260-652) and laminin.

We assessed admission noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomography angiography for thrombus location, thrombus load (clot burden score), and collateral status. Clinical data were extracted from medical charts. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of revascularization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2b) after ERT. A total of 63 patients were identified (median age, 73 years; interquartile range: 62-77; 40 females). Sixteen patients (25.4%) underwent intravenous thrombolysis (ivT) before ERT. Twenty-two patients (34.9%) had additional intra-arterial application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The overall recanalization rate was 66.7%, and 9.5% had symptomatic intracranial bleeding. In-hospital mortality was 15%, and 30% reached good functional outcome at discharge. In the univariate analysis, preceding ivT and the number of passes for thrombectomy (dichotomized ≤2 versus >2) were associated with recanalization. There was a trend for number of thrombectomy passes (as continuous variable) and multimodal ERT.

The ability of EPCs to differentiate into mature endothelial cells was investigated by light and fluorescence microscopy quantification in the presence or absence of PM/DM or control serum, neutralizing antibodies to type I IFN receptor or IL-18. Serum type I IFN activity was quantified by induction of type I IFN-inducible genes in HeLa cells. Circulating IL-18 concentrations were assessed by ELISA. Circulating EPCs were significantly lower in PM/DM patients compared with controls. PM/DM EPCs displayed a decreased capacity to differentiate into mature endothelial cells and PM/DM serum significantly inhibited differentiation of control EPCs.

Here, we investigated the status of ER stress chaperone; glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and its downstream UPR pathways in human obese, and their modulation by a supervised 3-month physical exercise. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and blood samples were collected from non-diabetic adult human lean (n=40) and obese (n=40, at baseline and after 3months of physical exercise). Transcriptomic profiling was used as a primary screen to identify differentially expressed genes and it was carried out on SAT samples using the UPR RT(2) Profiler PCR Array. Conventional RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western blot and ELISA were used to validate the transcriptomic data. Correlation analyses with the physical, clinical and biochemical outcomes were performed using Pearson's rank correlation coefficient. Levels of GRP78 and its three downstream UPR arms; activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) were increased in obese subjects. More interestingly, higher levels of circulating GRP78 protein were found in obese compared to lean subjects which correlated negatively with maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 Max) but positively with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and obesity indicators such as BMI, percentage body fat (PBF) and waist circumference. GRP78 increased secretion in obese was further confirmed in vitro using 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells under ER stress. Finally, we showed that physical exercise significantly attenuated the expression and release of GRP78 with a concomitant reduction in the phosphorylation of IRE1α and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α)."}]}

The WHO recommends that free sugars should be <10% of total energy intake (TEI) and that additional health benefits could be obtained with a reduction below 5% of TEI. The objective of this study was to estimate the total, intrinsic, and added sugar intake in the Mexican diet and to identify the food groups that are the main sources of these sugars. We used data from a national probabilistic survey [ENSANUT (National Health and Nutrition Survey) 2012], which represents 3 geographic regions and urban and rural areas. Dietary information was obtained by administering a 24-h recall questionnaire to 10,096 participants. Total sugar intake was estimated by using the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) food-composition table and an established method to estimate added sugars. The mean intakes of total, intrinsic, and added sugars were 365, 127, and 238 kcal/d, respectively. Added sugars contributed 13% of TEI. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) were the main source of sugars, contributing 69% of added sugars.

The main endpoints were prognostic value (hazard ratio [HR] for overall survival [OS] and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate), response rate of chemotherapy, radical resection rate, post-operative complication rate, and adverse effects of chemotherapy. Five randomized controlled trials and six clinical controlled trials involving 1,240 patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with the adjuvant chemotherapy group, the perioperative chemotherapy group had significantly better prognosis (HR, 0.74; 95 % CI, 0.61 to 0.89; P < 0.01).

{"query": "Does computer simulation of lumbar flexion show shear of the facet capsular ligament?", "topk": [{"text": "The lumbar facet capsular ligament (FCL) is a posterior spinal ligament with a complex structure and kinematic profile. The FCL has a curved geometry, multiple attachment sites, and preferentially aligned collagen fiber bundles on the posterior surface that are innervated with mechanoreceptive nerve endings. Spinal flexion induces three-dimensional (3D) deformations, requiring the FCL to maintain significant tensile and shear loads. Previous works aimed to study 3D facet joint kinematics during flexion, but to our knowledge none have reported localized FCL surface deformations likely created by this complex structure. The purpose of this study was to elucidate local deformations of both the posterior and anterior surfaces of the lumbar FCL to understand the distribution and magnitude of in-plane and through-plane deformations, including the prevalence of shear. The FCL anterior and posterior surface deformations were quantified through creation of a finite element model simulating facet joint flexion using a realistic geometry, physiological kinematics, and fitted constitutive material. Geometry was obtained from the micro-CT data of a healthy L3-L4 facet joint capsule (n=1); kinematics were extracted from sagittal plane fluoroscopic data of healthy volunteers (n=10) performing flexion; and average material properties were determined from planar biaxial extension tests of L4-L5 FCLs (n=6). All analyses were performed with the non-linear finite element solver, FEBio. A grid of equally spaced 3×3 nodes on the posterior surface identified regional differences within the strain fields and was used to create comparisons against previously published experimental data. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the authors have no disclosures. Inhomogeneous in-plane and through-plane shear deformations were prominent through the middle body of the FCL on both surfaces. Anterior surface deformations were more pronounced because of the small width of the joint space, whereas posterior surface deformations were more diffuse because the larger area increased deformability. We speculate these areas of large deformation may provide this proprioceptive system with an excellent measure of spinal motion."}]}
{"query": "Do histone deacetylase and GATA-binding factor 6 regulate arterial remodeling in angiotensin II-induced hypertension?", "topk": [{"text": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to improve essential and secondary hypertension. However, the specific HDAC that might serve as a therapeutic target and the associated upstream and downstream molecules involved in regulating hypertension remain unknown. Our study was aimed at investigating whether a selective inhibitor of class II HDAC (MC1568) modulates hypertension, elucidating the underlying mechanism. Hypertension was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II) to mice before treatment with MC1568. SBP was measured. Treatment with MC1568 reduced elevated SBP; attenuated arterial remodeling in the kidney's small arteries and thoracic aorta; and inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expression, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, DNA synthesis, and VSMC hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Ang II enhanced the expression of phosphorylated HDAC4 and GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6) proteins, which were specifically localized in the cytoplasm of cells in the arteries of kidneys and in aortas. Forced expression and knockdown of HDAC4 increased and decreased, respectively, the proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes in VSMCs. GATA6, a newly described binding partner of HDAC4, markedly enhanced the size and number of VSMCs. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα), but not HDAC4, translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to Ang II. CaMKIIα and protein kinase D1 were associated with VSMC hypertrophy and hyperplasia via direct interaction with HDAC4. MC1568 treatment weakened the association between HDAC4 and CaMKIIα."}]}

In the present study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a gE-deleted marker vaccine, strain YS-400, in young domestic pigs. The YS-400 strain was propagated in Vero cells, and the trial ADV bait vaccine (a vaccine blister in a matrix including an attractant) was prepared. Pigs were orally immunized with the vaccine (2 mL, 10(7.5) TCID50/mL) delivered using a syringe or in the bait vaccine. The animals were observed for 9 weeks after vaccination, and immunogenicity was assessed using a virus neutralization (VN) test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The YS-400 strain was non-pathogenic to pigs when given orally and induced high VN titers (1:32-1:128) 6 weeks post-administration. Of the pigs given the ADV bait vaccine twice or three times, 40% were seropositive by 2 weeks, and 100% were seropositive by 7 weeks after the first dose.

However, the effectiveness of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines on slowing the spread of the disease is questionable. In contrast, high potency vaccines providing early protection may solve issues with the spread of the disease, escaping mutants, and persistency. To increase the potency of the vaccine, additives such as saponin and aluminium hydroxide are used. However, the use of saponin with an oil adjuvant is not common and is sometimes linked to toxicity. QS-21, which is less toxic than Quil A, has been presented as an alternative for use with saponin. In this study, the addition of QS-21 to a commercially available foot-and-mouth disease water-in-oil-in-water emulsion vaccine was evaluated in cattle. After vaccination, serum samples were collected periodically over 3 months. Sera of the QS-21 and normal oil vaccine groups were compared via serum virus neutralization antibody titre and liquid phase blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody titre.

{"query": "Does mood influence the Concordance of Subjective and Objective Measures of Sleep Duration in Older Adults?", "topk": [{"text": "Sleep plays a central role in maintaining health and cognition. In most epidemiologic studies, sleep is evaluated by self-report questionnaires but several reports suggest that these evaluations might be less accurate than objective measures such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Determinants of the discrepancy between objective and subjective measures remain to be investigated. The aim of this pilot-study was to examine the role of mood states in determining the discrepancy observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration in older adults. Objective sleep quantity and quality were recorded by actigraphy in a sample of 45 elderly subjects over at least three consecutive nights. Subjective sleep duration and supplementary data, such as mood status and memory, were evaluated using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). A significant discrepancy was observed between EMA and actigraphic measures of sleep duration (p < 0.001). The magnitude of this difference was explained by the patient's mood status (p = 0.020). No association was found between the magnitude of this discrepancy and age, sex, sleep quality or memory performance."}]}
{"query": "Does detection of molecular bacterascites in decompensated cirrhosis define a risk with decreased survival?", "topk": [{"text": "The prognostic relevance of bacterial DNA (bactDNA) detection in ascitic fluid of patients with cirrhosis is still under debate. Using quantitative real-time PCR with broad-range primers targeting the V3 and V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene, we measured bactDNA concentrations in patients with and without leukocytic ascites and evaluated the impact on short-term survival. Ascites samples from 173 patients with decompensated cirrhosis were consecutively collected between February 2011 and December 2012. BactDNA-positive ascites samples were sequenced and chromatograms were identified using RipSeq. Clinical data collection and survival analyses were carried out retrospectively and correlated with ascites bactDNA levels. BactDNA was detected qualitatively with a similar frequency in both nonleukocytic and leukocytic ascites [40% (57/144) and 43.5% (10/23), respectively; P=0.724]. However, the median bactDNA level was significantly higher in leukocytic ascites than in nonleukocytic ascites (1.2×10 vs. 5.7×10 copies/ml; P=0.008). Patients' survival was associated significantly with bactDNA level. The 30-day and 180-day survival was reduced if bactDNA was above the quantification limit of 520 copies/ml (84 and 63% vs. 72 and 43%, respectively; P<0.05) and worst if bactDNA was above 5000 copies/ml.

Randomly selected records of patients with a diagnosis of SpA and at least one visit to a rheumatology unit within the previous 2 years were audited. The rates of rheumatology visits and of referrals to other medical specialties were estimated-total and between centres-in the study period. Multilevel regression was used to analyse factors associated with variability and to adjust for clinical and patient characteristics. 1168 patients' records (45 centres) were reviewed, mainly ankylosing spondylitis (55.2 %) and psoriatic arthritis (22.2 %). The patients had incurred in 5908 visits to rheumatology clinics (rate 254 per 100 patient-years), 4307 visits to other medical specialties (19.6 % were referrals from rheumatology), and 775 visits to specialised nurse clinics. An adjusted variability in frequenting rheumatology clinics of 15.7 % between centres was observed. This was partially explained by the number of faculties and trainees. The adjusted intercentre variability for referrals to other specialties was 12.3 %, and it was associated with urban settings, number of procedures, and existence of SpA dedicated clinics; the probability of a patient with SpA of being referred to other specialist may increase up to 25 % depending on the treating centre."}]}

FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) has been characterized as an important regulator of bone metabolism and is confirmed to cross-talk with PTH/PTHrP signal in cartilage and bone development. Fgfr3 knockout and wild-type mice at 2-month-old and 4-month-old were intraperitoneally injected with PTH intermittently for 4 weeks and then the skeletal responses to PTH were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), micro-computed tomography (μCT) and bone histomorphometry. Intermittent PTH treatment improved bone mineral density (BMD) and femoral mechanical properties in both Fgfr3 (-/-) and wild-type mice. Histomorphometric analysis showed that bone formation and bone resorption were increased in both genotypes following PTH treatment. PTH treatment increased trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in WT and Fgfr3-deficient mice. The anabolic response in Fgfr3-deficient and wild-type bone is characterized by an increase of both bone formation and resorption-related genes following PTH treatment. In addition, we found that Fgfr3 null osteoblasts (compared to wild-type controls) maintained normal abilities to response to PTH-stimulated increase of proliferation, differentiation, expression of osteoblastic marker genes (Cbfa1, Osteopontin and Osteocalcin), and phosphorylation of Erk1/2."}]}

Male Wistar rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation, and primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were treated with hypoxia or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). BDNF level in rat ventricles was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). miR-195 mimic, inhibitor or negative control was transfected into the cardiomyocytes. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. Cardiac function and apoptosis were detected in MI rats intravenously injected with antagomiR-195. Luciferase assay, Western blot and Real-time RT-PCR were employed to clarify the interplay between miR-195 and BDNF. miR-195 level was dynamically regulated in response to MI and significantly increased in ischemic regions 24 h post-MI as well as in hypoxic or H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, BDNF protein level was rapidly increased in MI rats and H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis in both hypoxic and H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes were markedly reduced and cell viability was increased by miR-195 inhibitor. Moreover, inhibition of miR-195 significantly improved cardiac function of MI rats. Bcl-2 but not BDNF was validated as the direct target of miR-195.

Functional and histological kidney damage, and inflammation were compared and the effect of anti-vWF antibodies in ADAMTS13 KO mice was assessed. Following IRI, the blood and kidney ADAMTS13 levels were significantly decreased. vWF expression was significantly upregulated in both the medulla and cortex of injured kidneys as shown by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. There was also an increased level of vWF dimers after IRI. In ADAMTS13 KO mice, kidney vWF levels were further increased and this was associated with greater endothelial and epithelial injury compared to WT mice, suggesting an important role of vWF in renal IRI.

{"query": "Do rapid and accurate identification of Xanthomonas citri subspecies citri by fluorescence in situ hybridization?", "topk": [{"text": "Citrus canker is an economically important disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc). This organism targets a wide range of citrus plants, including sweet orange, grapefruit, lemon and lime. As Xcc is spread by environmental factors such as wind and rain, it is difficult to control its movement once the disease has established. In order to facilitate monitoring of citrus canker we sought to design a novel diagnostic protocol based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for identification of bacterial cells directly from canker pustules without cultivation or DNA extraction. This method was validated for specificity against a range of Xanthomonas species and strains. We show that our assay is extremely rapid (typically requiring between 2 and 3 h), and possesses a similar specificity to existing PCR diagnostic tools. The sensitivity of the assay is comparable to that of an existing PCR-based technique and sufficient for identifying Xcc in symptomatic plant material. The method is easily transferable to diagnosticians without prior experience using FISH."}]}
{"query": "Is cannabigerol a novel , well-tolerated appetite stimulant in pre-satiated rats?", "topk": [{"text": "The appetite-stimulating properties of cannabis are well documented and have been predominantly attributed to the hyperphagic activity of the psychoactive phytocannabinoid, ∆(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆(9)-THC). However, we have previously shown that a cannabis extract devoid of ∆(9)-THC still stimulates appetite, indicating that other phytocannabinoids also elicit hyperphagia. One possible candidate is the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG), which has affinity for several molecular targets with known involvement in the regulation of feeding behaviour. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of CBG on food intake and feeding pattern microstructure. Male Lister hooded rats were administered CBG (30-120 mg/kg, per ora (p.o.)) or placebo and assessed in open field, static beam and grip strength tests to determine a neuromotor tolerability profile for this cannabinoid. Subsequently, CBG (at 30-240 mg/kg, p.o.) or placebo was administered to a further group of pre-satiated rats, and hourly intake and meal pattern data were recorded over 2 h. CBG produced no adverse effects on any parameter in the neuromotor tolerability test battery. In the feeding assay, 120-240 mg/kg CBG more than doubled total food intake and increased the number of meals consumed, and at 240 mg/kg reduced latency to feed.

BUO episodes (n = 425) were classified as HCA (n = 215) and CA (n = 210), and one blood isolate per episode was collected. Susceptibility testing was performed, ESBLs were screened by double-disc diffusion test and ESBL and OXA-1 genes were characterized (PCR and sequencing). Population structure (phylogenetic groups, XbaI-PFGE and MLST) and ST131 subtyping (PCR) were determined. Virulence genes were detected by PCR and virulence score, profiles and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) status calculated. ESBL-producing E. coli prevalence was 9.2% (39/425). ESBL-producing E. coli episodes were significantly associated with HCA-BUO episodes [14% (30/215) versus 4.3% (9/210); P = 0.001].

In this study we aimed to investigate, which structural component of biglycan is responsible for its cardiocytoprotective effect and to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytoprotection. A pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that both native (glycanated) and deglycanated biglycan can attenuate cell death induced by SI/R in a dose-dependent manner in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from Wistar rats. In separate experiments, we have shown that similarly to glycanated biglycan, recombinant human biglycan core protein (rhBGNc) protects cardiomyocytes against SI/R injury. In contrast, the glycosaminoglycan component dermatan sulfate had no significant effect on cell viability, while chondroitin sulfate further enhanced cell death induced by SI/R. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc reverses the effect of SI/R upon markers of necrosis, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and autophagy. We have also shown that pharmacological blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling or its downstream mediators (IRAK1/4, ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases) abolished the cytoprotective effect of rhBGNc against SI/R injury. Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc for 20h resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and NO production without having significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and on the production of superoxide. Treatment over 10min and 1h with rhBGNc increased ERK1 phosphorylation, while the SI/R-induced increase in superoxide production was attenuated by rhBGNc.

Therefore, we employed an autochthonous mouse model of Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma resembling human lung adenocarcinoma to investigate the role of Ercc1 in the response to cisplatin treatment. Our data show that Ercc1 deficiency in Tp53-deficient murine lung adenocarcinoma induces a more aggressive tumor phenotype that displays enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, tumors that relapsed after cisplatin treatment in our model develop a robust etoposide sensitivity that is independent of the Ercc1 status and depends solely on previous cisplatin exposure.

No adverse events were reported following any of the BTX-A injections. BTX-A was safe and effective in the eight patients with pre-existing swallowing dysfunction. Subsequent drooling surgery was performed in 15 (57.7%) of the cohort, all 15 patients responded to BTX-A injections. In patients with Cerebral Palsy, there was no correlation between the severity of the neurological dysfunction as measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) score and the response to BTX-A treatment."}]}

Thus, supplementation with NAD(+) and NADP(+) precursors emerged as a promising strategy to gain many and multifaceted health benefits. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to investigate whether chronic nicotinamide riboside administration (an NAD(+) precursor) affects exercise performance. Eighteen Wistar rats were equally divided in two groups that received either saline vehicle or nicotinamide riboside at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight/day for 21 days via gavage. At the end of the 21-day administration protocol, both groups performed an incremental swimming performance test. The nicotinamide riboside group showed a tendency towards worse physical performance by 35 % compared to the control group at the final 10 % load (94 ± 53 s for the nicotinamide riboside group and 145 ± 59 s for the control group; P = 0.071)."}]}
{"query": "Are full-length autonomous transposable elements preferentially targeted by expression-dependent forms of RNA-directed DNA methylation?", "topk": [{"text": "Chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation are targeted to transposable elements by small RNAs in a process termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In plants, canonical RdDM functions through RNA polymerase IV to reinforce pre-existing transposable element silencing. Recent investigations have identified a \"non-canonical\" form of RdDM dependent on RNA polymerase II expression to initiate and re-establish silencing of active transposable elements. This expression-dependent RdDM mechanism functions through RNAi degradation of transposable element mRNAs into small RNAs guided by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) protein and is therefore referred to as RDR6-RdDM. We performed whole-genome MethylC-seq in 20 mutants that distinguish RdDM mechanisms when transposable elements are either transcriptionally silent or active. We identified a new mechanism of expression-dependent RdDM, which functions through DICER-LIKE3 (DCL3) but bypasses the requirement of both RNA polymerase IV and RDR6 (termed DCL3-RdDM). We found that RNA polymerase II expression-dependent forms of RdDM function on over 20 % of transcribed transposable elements, including the majority of full-length elements with all of the domains required for autonomous transposition. Lastly, we find that RDR6-RdDM preferentially targets long transposable elements due to the specificity of primary small RNAs to cleave full-length mRNAs."}]}

Four isogenic cell lines C2/C2VHL and 786-O/786-OVHL with differential VHL expression are used in our studies. Cobalt chloride is used to mimic hypoxia in vitro. HIF-2α knockdowns in C2 and 786-O cells is used to evaluate the effect on HDAC 1 expression and activity. Invasion and migration assays are used to investigate the role of HDAC 1 and HDAC 6 expression in ccRCC cells. Comparisons are made between experimental groups using the paired T-test, the two-sample Student's T-test or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. ccRCC and the TCGA dataset are used to observe the clinical correlation between HDAC 1 and HDAC 6 overexpression and overall and progression free survival. Our analysis of tumor and matched non-tumor tissues from radical nephrectomies showed overexpression of class I and II HDACs (HDAC6 only in a subset of patients). In vitro, both HDAC1 and HDAC6 over-expression increased cell invasion and motility, respectively, in ccRCC cells. HDAC1 regulated invasiveness by increasing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Furthermore, hypoxia stimulation in VHL-reconstituted cell lines increased HIF isoforms and HDAC1 expression. Presence of hypoxia response elements in the HDAC1 promoter along with chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggests that HIF-2α is a transcriptional regulator of HDAC1 gene. Conversely, HDAC6 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) were co-localized in cytoplasm of ccRCC cells and HDAC6 enhanced cell motility by decreasing acetylated α-tubulin expression, and this biological effect was attenuated by either biochemical or pharmacological inhibition. Finally, analysis of human ccRCC specimens revealed positive correlation between HIF isoforms and HDAC. HDAC1 mRNA upregulation was associated with worse overall survival in the TCGA dataset."}]}

As the skin grafts contract, the postoperative framework is distorted. This leads to a decrease in the auriculocephalic angle. The objective of this study was to test a new method to cover the reconstructive framework by using three skin flaps and a larger tissue expander than that normally used. This may reduce the distortion of the reconstructed ear and create a well-shaped auriculocephalic angle. A large expander was inserted in the postauricular mastoid area. Three expanded flaps were then created to cover the anterior and posterior frameworks, with separate mastoid coverage. By measuring the height and angle at three different points on the reconstructed ear and comparing them with the contralateral normal ear, a system for measuring the auriculocephalic angle was established. The surface of the framework and the mastoid area were covered by three flaps developed from one large tissue expander. The appearance of the reconstructed ears was similar to that of the normal side by the patient's 6- to 12-month follow-up. The difference in the distance at the three points between the reconstructed and normal sides after the three-flap reconstruction was less than that following traditional reconstruction (p < 0.05). The variation in the angle measured at these three points in the three-flap group was also much smaller than that in the traditional group (p < 0.01)."}]}

Targeting microRNA (miRNA) has been considered as a therapeutic strategy against cancers. Human miR-204-5p potentially targeting BCL2 has been reported to be downregulated in various cancers. We hypothesized that miR-204-5p overexpression induces cancer cell apoptosis by repressing BCL2 expression. A vector harboring mature miR-204-5p was constructed and delivered into human PCa cells. The expression level of miR-204-5p was determined by miRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the function of mature miR-204-5p and its direct binding to BCL2 transcripts. The expression levels of BCL-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein samples were measured by QPCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell viability was detected by WST-1 assays. Induction of apoptosis was determined by increased levels of cleavage caspase 3 and caspase 3/7 activity. The expression levels of miR-204-5p were downregulated in PCa cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells. Transfection of pSM-204 resulted in up to 6.2-fold higher expression of miR-204-5p when compared with pSM control. The mRNA levels of several potential target genes of miR-204-5p were decreased in pSM-204-transfected PC3 and Rv1 cells. BCL2 mRNA and protein expression decreased in miR-204-5p-transfected cells, which led to cytochrome C release from mitochondria. It subsequently increased cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 3/7 activities and reduced cell viability. Cotransfection of a reporter vector harboring the BCL2 3'-untranslated region to compete with endogenous transcripts partially rescued miR-204-5p-induced apoptosis."}]}

BRCA1 was detected immunohistochemically with rabbit anti-BRCA1 polyclonal antibody. The intensity of BRCA1 expression was semiquantitatively assessed for cardiocytes, small vessels including capillaries, and interstitial cells. The significances between groups were estimated using the Mann-Whitney U test. All IDCM cases were positive and presented nonuniform BRCA1 expression: hypertrophied cardiocytes showed very intense staining and typical cardiomyopathic cardiocytes were stained weakly forming mosaic. Control cases showed weak-to-moderate uniform staining. Intensity of staining was significantly higher in IDCM cardiocytes, whereas small vessels and interstitial were stained similarly in both groups."}]}
{"query": "Does direct transfer of HRPII-magnetic bead complexes to malaria rapid diagnostic tests significantly improve test sensitivity?", "topk": [{"text": "The characteristic ease of use, rapid time to result, and low cost of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) promote their widespread use at the point-of-care for malaria detection and surveillance. However, in many settings, the success of malaria elimination campaigns depends on point-of-care diagnostics with greater sensitivity than currently available RDTs. To address this need, a sample preparation method was developed to deliver more biomarkers onto a malaria RDT by concentrating the biomarker from blood sample volumes that are too large to be directly applied to a lateral flow strip. In this design, Ni-NTA-functionalized magnetic beads captured the Plasmodium falciparum biomarker HRPII from a P. falciparum D6 culture spiked blood sample. This transfer of magnetic beads to the RDT was facilitated by an inexpensive 3D-printed apparatus that aligned the sample tube with the sample deposition pad and a magnet beneath the RDT. Biomarkers were released from the bead surface onto the lateral flow strip using imidazole-spiked running buffer. Kinetics of HRPII binding to the Ni-NTA beads as a function of blood sample volume were explored prior to determining the effect of the proposed method on the limit of detection of Paracheck RDTs. More than 80 % of HRPII biomarkers were extracted from blood sample volumes ranging from 25 to 250 µL. The time required to reach 80 % binding ranged from 5 to 60 min, depending on sample volume. Using 250 μL of blood and a 30-min biomarker binding time, the limit of detection of the Paracheck Pf RDT brand was improved by 21-fold, resulting in a limit of detection below 1 parasite/μL."}]}

Because ALA-mediated PDT exhibits dual specificity in the context of tumor killing, this therapy could represent a less invasive, but effective, treatment for this disease. To assess ALA dark toxicity in MG-63 cells, cells were incubated with varying concentrations of ALA, and cell viability was determined by crystal violet assay. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation was assessed subsequent to ALA incubation at various concentrations using spectrofluorometry. Cell death subsequent to ALA-PDT was determined by illuminating cells at a wavelength of 635 nm at various light intensities subsequent to ALA incubation. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. ALA dark toxicity was observed only at the highest concentrations of 2, 5, and 10 mM. Maximal PpIX concentration was observed at 0.5 and 1 mM ALA, subsequent to a 24-h incubation.

Clock gene dynamics in ex vivo IVD explants (from PER2:: luciferase (LUC) reporter mice) and human disc cells (transduced with lentivirus containing Per2::luc reporters) were monitored in real time by bioluminescence photon counting and imaging. Temporal gene expression changes were studied by RNAseq and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. IVD pathology was evaluated by histology in a mouse model with tissue-specific deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1. Here we show the existence of the circadian rhythm in mouse IVD tissue and human disc cells. This rhythm is dampened with ageing in mice and can be abolished by treatment with interleukin-1β but not tumour necrosis factor α. Time-series RNAseq revealed 607 genes with 24-hour patterns of expression representing several essential pathways in IVD physiology.

This study explored the expression and underlying mechanism of WNT2 in PLNM of cervical cancer. WNT2 expression level in cervical cancer was detected using western blotting, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Two WNT2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used to explore the effects of WNT2 on invasive and metastatic ability of cancer cells, and to reveal the possible mechanism of WNT2 affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The correlation between WNT2 expression and PLNM was further investigated in clinical cervical specimens. Both WNT2 mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in cervical cancer. High WNT2 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, lymphovascular space involvement, positive parametrium, and most importantly, PLNM. PLNM and WNT2 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and disease-free survival. WNT2 knockdown inhibited SiHa cell motility and invasion and reversed EMT by inhibiting the WNT2/β-catenin pathway. WNT2 overexpression in cervical cancer was associated with β-catenin activation and induction of EMT, which further contributed to metastasis in cervical cancer."}]}

We demonstrate a dynamic expression pattern of glob1 in somatic and germ cell derivatives of developing egg chambers during various stages of oogenesis, which largely confines around the F-actin-rich cellular components. Reduced expression of glob1 leads to various types of abnormalities during oogenesis, which were primarily mediated by the inappropriately formed F-actin-based cytoskeleton.

{"query": "Is frequent Surfing on Social Health Networks Associated With Increased Knowledge and Patient Health Activation?", "topk": [{"text": "The advent of the Internet has driven a technological revolution that has changed our lives. As part of this phenomenon, social networks have attained a prominent role in health care. A variety of medical services is provided over the Internet, including home monitoring, interactive communications between the patient and service providers, and social support, among others. This study emphasizes some of the practical implications of Web-based health social networks for patients and for health care systems. The objective of this study was to assess how participation in a social network among individuals with a chronic condition contributed to patient activation, based on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). A prospective, cross-sectional survey with a retrospective component was conducted. Data were collected from Camoni, a Hebrew-language Web-based social health network, participants in the diabetes mellitus, pain, hypertension, and depression/anxiety forums, during November 2012 to 2013. Experienced users (enrolled at least 6 months) and newly enrolled received similar versions of the same questionnaire including sociodemographics and PAM. Among 686 participants, 154 of 337 experienced and 123 of 349 newly enrolled completed the questionnaire. Positive correlations (P<.05) were found between frequency and duration of site visits and patient activation, social relationships, and chronic disease knowledge. Men surfed longer than women (χ²3=10.104, P<.05). Experienced users with diabetes surfed more than those with other illnesses and had significantly higher PAM scores (mean, M=69.3, standard deviation, SD=19.1, PAM level 4; Z=-4.197, P<.001) than new users (M=62.8, SD=18.7, PAM level 3). Disease knowledge directly predicted PAM for all users (β=.26 and .21, respectively). Frequency and duration of social health network use were correlated with increased knowledge about a chronic disease. Experienced surfers had higher PAM than newly enrolled, suggesting that continued site use may contribute to increased activation."}]}

Although it is recognized that occupational use of bleach may have adverse respiratory health effects, it is unknown whether common domestic use of bleach may be a risk factor for asthma. To assess whether the domestic use of bleach for home cleaning is associated with asthma and other respiratory outcomes. Questionnaire-based information on respiratory symptoms and cleaning habits and data from skin prick-tests, bronchial responsiveness challenge and white blood cells were analyzed in 607 women participating in the follow-up of the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA). Bleach use was evaluated in 3 categories (<1 day/week; 1-3 days/week; 4-7 days/week \"frequent\"). Overall, 37% of the women reported using bleach weekly. Women using bleach frequently (11%) were more likely to have current asthma as compared to non-users (adjusted Odds-Ratio (aOR) = 1.7; 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) 1.0-3.0). Among women with asthma, frequent use of bleach was significantly associated with higher blood neutrophil cell counts. Bleach use was significantly associated with non-allergic asthma (aOR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.1), and more particularly with non-allergic adult-onset asthma (aOR 4.9; 95%CI 2.0-11.6).

{"query": "Does thrombomodulin influence the Survival of Patients with Non-Metastatic Colorectal Cancer through Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT )?", "topk": [{"text": "Treatment resistance and metastasis are the major causes of death among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Approximately 20% of surgically treated patients ultimately develop metastases during the follow-up period. Currently, the TNM system is the only available prognostic test. Therefore, the identification of new markers for CRC remains important. Thrombomodulin (TM), a glycoprotein, is involved in angiogenesis and has been linked to many malignant diseases. However, the function of TM in CRC remains unclear. A total of 170 patients with CRC participated in this study. TM expression was analyzed via immunohistochemistry. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) analysis was used to analyze patient outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). TM expression was manipulated using shRNA or an overexpression system. Transwell migration assays, wound healing migration assays, and the xCELLigence biosensor system were used to detect cell proliferative and migratory capacities. TM expression in the tumor tissues significantly and positively correlated with the DFS and OS of non-metastatic patients with CRC (ps = 0.036 and 0.0218, respectively). Suppression of TM expression increased the proliferation and migration of DLD-1 cells. TM overexpression reduced the cells' proliferative and migratory capacities. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression was up-regulated following TM silencing. Furthermore, the association between the migration of colon cancer cells and the levels of TM and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (fibronectin, vimentin and ezrin) was confirmed in HT29 and DLD-1 cells."}]}

We retrospectively analyzed 2456 patients with stage IA-IVA uterine cervical cancer who received definitive radiotherapy with (37.4%) or without (62.6%) platinum-based chemotherapy between 1986 and 2012. TRL was defined as two or more occurrences of leukocytosis over 9000/μl at the time of diagnosis and during the course of treatment. Locoregional failure-free survival (LFFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with or without TRL. The median age of all patients was 55 years, and the median follow-up time was 65.1 months. TRL was observed in 398 patients (16%) at initial diagnosis; TRL (+) patients were younger and had larger tumors, advanced stage, and more frequent lymph node metastases (all P < 0.05). TRL (+) patients showed a significantly lower rate of complete remission than TRL (-) patients (89.9% versus 96.3%, respectively, P = 0.042). Ten-year LFFS and OS for all patients were 84% and 78%, respectively.

This study utilized an in vitro model of PVR to investigate the role of acetylation in RPE activation and its contribution to the progression of this disease. ARPE-19 cells, primary cultures of porcine RPE, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPS-RPE) were utilized for cellular and molecular analyses. Cells treated with transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFβ2; 10 ng/mL) alone or in the presence of the broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA; 0.1 μM), were assessed for contraction and migration through collagen contraction and scratch assays, respectively. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis were performed to assess α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and β-catenin expression after TGFβ2 treatment alone or in combination with TSA. TGFβ2 significantly increased RPE cell contraction in collagen matrix and this effect was inhibited in the presence of TSA (0.1 μM).

TNBC is defined negative for the protein expression of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). One prominent feature of this cancer type is the frequent overexpression of major components of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system (uPAS) including uPA, its receptor uPAR and the inhibitor PAI-1, which may be valuable as therapeutic targets. Direct interactions of uPAR with interactors were demonstrated by immunoprecipitations and proximity ligation assays. For stable knockdowns of target proteins, lentiviral vectors were used and the effects were analysed by immunoblottings and using in vitro cell viability, migration and invasion assays. Immunohistochemical and statistical analyses of biomarkers and clinical parameters were conducted in a TNBC cohort (n = 174).

{"query": "Do multiple syntrophic interactions drive biohythane production from waste sludge in microbial electrolysis cells?", "topk": [{"text": "Biohythane is a new and high-value transportation fuel present as a mixture of biomethane and biohydrogen. It has been produced from different organic matters using anaerobic digestion. Bioenergy can be recovered from waste activated sludge through methane production during anaerobic digestion, but energy yield is often insufficient to sludge disposal. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is also a promising approach for bioenergy recovery and waste sludge disposal as higher energy efficiency and biogas production. The systematic understanding of microbial interactions and biohythane production in MEC is still limited. Here, we report biohythane production from waste sludge in biocathode microbial electrolysis cells and reveal syntrophic interactions in microbial communities based on high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR targeting 16S rRNA gene. The alkali-pretreated sludge fed MECs (AS-MEC) showed the highest biohythane production rate of 0.148 L·L(-1)-reactor·day(-1), which is 40 and 80 % higher than raw sludge fed MECs (RS-MEC) and anaerobic digestion (open circuit MEC, RS-OCMEC). Current density, metabolite profiles, and hydrogen-methane ratio results all confirm that alkali-pretreatment and microbial electrolysis greatly enhanced sludge hydrolysis and biohythane production. Illumina Miseq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons indicates that anode biofilm was dominated by exoelectrogenic Geobacter, fermentative bacteria and hydrogen-producing bacteria in the AS-MEC. The cathode biofilm was dominated by fermentative Clostridium. The dominant archaeal populations on the cathodes of AS-MEC and RS-MEC were affiliated with hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium (98 %, relative abundance) and Methanocorpusculum (77 %), respectively. Multiple pathways of gas production were observed in the same MEC reactor, including fermentative and electrolytic H2 production, as well as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and electromethanogenesis. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that higher amount of methanogens were enriched in AS-MEC than that in RS-MEC and RS-OCMEC, suggesting that alkali-pretreated sludge and MEC facilitated hydrogenotrophic methanogen enrichment."}]}

This study is aimed to characterize the role of SMARCE1/BAF57 in regulating metastasis of breast cancer cells. Genetic approaches and chemical inhibitors were used to manipulate the activities of SMARCE1 and its downstream targets in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Xenograft mouse models were used to analyze the role of SMARCE1 in lung metastasis in vivo. Nonadherent culture conditions were used to elucidate the role of SMARCE1 in regulating anoikis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting assays were designed to dissect the mechanism of action of SMARCE1. Public databases were used to investigate the relationship between SMARCE1 deregulation and breast cancer prognosis. SMARCE1 knockdown reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer cells and sensitized tumor cells to anoikis. In response to loss of attachment, SMARCE1 interacted with and potentiated transcriptional activity of HIF1A, resulting in rapid PTK2 activation. Both HIF1A and PTK2 were indispensable for SMARCE1-mediated protection against anoikis by promoting activation of ERK and AKT pathways while suppressing the expression of pro-apoptotic BIM protein. Expression data analysis of a large cohort of human breast tumors revealed that high expression of SMARCE1 or PTK2 is associated with poor prognosis and tumor relapse, and PTK2 expression is positively correlated with SMARCE1 expression in basal-like and luminal B subtypes of breast tumors."}]}

Using nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm clustered the methylation pattern and reduced the candidate genes. We verified in pools DNA from endometrial cancer tissues and cervical scrapings, and validated in 146 cervical scrapings from patients with endometrioid-type endometrial cancer (n = 50), uterine myoma (n = 40), and healthy controls (n = 56) using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP). The logistic regression was used to evaluate the performance of methylation signal and gene combination. We filtered out 180 methylated genes, which constituted four consensus clusters. Serial testing of tissues and cervical scrapings detected 14 genes that are hypermethylated in endometrial cancer. Three genes, BHLHE22, CDO1, and CELF4, had the best performance. Individual genes were sensitivity of 83.7%-96.0% and specificity of 78.7%-96.0%.

Although little is known about the underlying regulation of sympetaly, genetic pathways ancestrally involved in organ boundary establishment (e.g. CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON [CUC] 1-3 genes) are strong candidates. In sympetalous petunia, mutations in the CUC1/2-like orthologue NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) inhibit shoot apical meristem formation. Despite this, occasional 'escape shoots' develop flowers with extra petals and fused inter-floral whorl organs. Central methods: To To determine if petunia CUC-like genes regulate additional floral patterning, we used virus-induced silencing (VIGS) following establishment of healthy shoot apices to re-examine the role of NAM in petunia petal development, and uniquely characterise the CUC3 orthologue NH16. Confirming previous results, we found that reduced floral NAM/NH16 expression caused increased petal-stamen and stamen-carpel fusion, and often produced extra petals. However, further to previous results, all VIGS plants infected with NAM or NH16 constructs exhibited reduced fusion in the petal whorl compared to control plants."}]}

This research explored the potential for faith-based organisations (FBOs) to be used as community organisations for overweight and obesity prevention interventions in adolescents by assessing the readiness of religious leaders to engage in such interventions. Surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 51 religious leaders in Johannesburg and Soweto. The Community Readiness Model (CRM) survey was chosen to determine the stage of readiness of this community regarding overweight and obesity prevention. Six different dimensions were assessed in the CRM (community efforts, knowledge of efforts, leadership, community climate, knowledge of the issue, resources). The surveys were scored according to the CRM protocol. The survey data were supplemented with findings from FGDs. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the FGDs. The mean community readiness score was 2.57 ± 0.76 which equates with the \"denial/resistance stage\". The mean readiness score for resources was the highest of all the dimensions (3.77 ± 0.28), followed by knowledge of the issue (3.20 ± 0.51).

Identifying the mechanisms responsible for regulating chemotherapy resistance is crucial for improving OS treatment. This study was performed in two human OS cell lines (the multi-chemosensitive OS cell line G-292 and the multi-chemoresistant OS cell line SJSA-1). The levels of miR-20a-5p and KIF26B mRNA expression were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. KIF26B protein levels were determined by western blot analysis. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. We found that miR-20a-5p was more highly expressed in G-292 cells than in SJSA-1 cells. Forced expression of miR-20a-5p counteracted OS cell chemoresistance in both cell culture and tumor xenografts in nude mice. One of miR-20a-5p's targets, kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B), was found to mediate the miR-20a-5p-induced reduction in OS chemoresistance by modulating the activities of the MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways."}]}

In this study, 114 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 17 tandem repeat polymorphisms from Nitric Oxide Synthases (NOS) regions were analyzed in 1686 individuals from 35 populations from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. NOS genes encode for key enzymes on nitric oxide availability, which is involved in several cardiovascular processes. These genetic variations were used to test for selection and to infer the population structure of NOS regions. Moreover, we tested whether the variation in the incidence of coronary events and in the levels of classical risk factors in 11 of these European populations could be explained by the population structure estimates. Our results supported, first, the absence of clear signs of selection for NOS genetic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases, and second, the presence of a continuous genetic pattern of variation across European and North African populations without a Mediterranean barrier for gene flow. Finally, population structure estimates from NOS regions are closely correlated with coronary event rates and classical risk parameters (explaining 39-98%) among European populations."}]}

In the present study, we exposed a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3) to Cd for 24 h, followed by a 24 h BPA exposure to evaluate toxicity. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by viability with CCK-8 assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). And DNA damage was measured by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) and the comet assay. The flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and western blot against poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). The results showed that Cd or BPA treatments alone (with the exception of BPA exposure at 50 μM) did not alter cell viability. However, pre-treatment with Cd aggravated the BPA-induced reduction in cell viability; increased BPA-induced LDH release, ROS production, DNA damage and G2 phase arrest; and elevated BPA-induced TUNEL-positive cells and the expression levels of cleaved PARP. Cd exposure concurrently decreased the expression of 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), whereas OGG1 over-expression abolished the enhancement of Cd on BPA-induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity."}]}

Using Apc-mutant Min mice, we investigated the effects of ADAM17/10 inhibitor INCB3619 on tumorigenesis. To assess the effects of colonocyte ADAM17, mice with ADAM17 conditional deletion were treated with azoxymethane (AOM). ADAM17 expression was also compared in colonocytes from primary human colon cancers and adjacent mucosa. CXCL12 treatment activated colon cancer cell EGFR signals, and CXCR4 or ADAM17 blockade reduced this activation. In vivo, Western diet increased CXCL12 in stromal cells and TGFα in colonocytes. Marimastat or AMD3100 caused >50% reduction in EGFR signals (P < 0.05). In Min mice, INCB3619 reduced EGFR signals in adenomas and inhibited intestinal tumor multiplicity (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that preconditioning of mesenchymal stromal cells with carbon monoxide ex vivo would promote further therapeutic benefit when cells are administered in vivo after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis in mice. Animal study and primary cell culture. Laboratory investigation. BALB/c mice. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Mesenchymal stromal cells, mesenchymal stromal cells-conditioned with carbon monoxide, fibroblasts, or fibroblasts-conditioned with carbon monoxide were delivered by tail vein injections to septic mice. The mice were assessed for survival, bacterial clearance, and the inflammatory response during sepsis in each of the groups. Mesenchymal stromal cells were also assessed for their ability to promote bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils, the production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators, and their importance for mesenchymal stromal cells function using gene silencing. Ex vivo preconditioning with carbon monoxide allowed mesenchymal stromal cells to be administered later after the onset of sepsis (6 hr), and yet maintain their therapeutic effect with increased survival. Carbon monoxide preconditioned mesenchymal stromal cells were also able to alleviate organ injury, improve bacterial clearance, and promote the resolution of inflammation. Mesenchymal stromal cells exposed to carbon monoxide, with docosahexaenoic acid substrate, produced specialized proresolving lipid mediators, particularly D-series resolvins, which promoted survival. Silencing of lipoxygenase pathways (5-lipoxygenase and 12/15-lipoxygenase), which are important enzymes for specialized proresolving lipid mediator biosynthesis, resulted in a loss of therapeutic benefit bestowed on mesenchymal stromal cells by carbon monoxide."}]}

After Institutional Review Board's approval, all endosonographic procedures performed by interventional pulmonary between July 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed. Those including biopsy of sub-diaphragmatic sites were then selected for analysis. Over the study interval, 45 sub-diaphragmatic biopsy procedures (25 left adrenal glands, 7 liver, and 13 celiac node) were performed with EUS-B. In all cases, cellular adequacy was present, and samples were large enough for immunohistochemistry and any relevant ancillary studies. Metastatic malignancy was documented in 58% of cases, 16% of cases contained benign diagnostic findings, and in 27% of cases, normal organ tissue was documented. There were no complications."}]}

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), an emerging cardiovascular risk factor, is characterized by sympathetic activation and increased oxidative stress which are regulators of LDL-C metabolism. We hypothesized that OSA was associated with LDL-C variability. We prospectively recruited 190 patients with coronary artery disease for an overnight sleep study. Statin was prescribed upon discharge for 186 patients. Serum LDL-C levels were measured at clinic every 3 to 6 months. Severity of OSA (on the basis of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)) was correlated with visit-to-visit LDL-C variability (on the basis of variation independent of mean (VIM)) in outpatient clinic. The mean AHI was 21.9 ± 18.9. Using an AHI cut-off of 5-14.9, 15-29.9, and ≥30, the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe OSA was 26.3, 18.9, and 27.4 %, respectively. After 53.2 ± 25.3 months, LDL-C was recorded over 8.1 ± 4.2 measurements. VIM positively correlated with AHI (Pearson's r = 0.183, p = 0.016), but not body mass index, baseline and mean follow-up LDL-C levels, and number of LDL-C measurements. In multiple linear regression analysis, AHI remained an independent predictor of VIM after adjusting for diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

If their care is inadequate, these patients can rapidly deteriorate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether mortality for patients admitted with C difficile differed between medical and general/colorectal surgery services. This was a retrospective cohort study with multivariable logistic regression used to evaluate the effect of admitting service on in-hospital mortality rates, with propensity score matching used to validate this relationship. The study was conducted at a single, tertiary care center. Inpatients with a positive C difficile stool test within 24 hours of admission to medical or surgical services were identified (2005-2015) using institutional electronic data sources. We measured inpatient mortality rate. Of 1175 patients, 985 (83%) were admitted to medical services, whereas 190 (17%) were admitted by surgeons. Medical patients were older (63.9 vs 58.9 years; p = 0.001) and had a mean of 0.6 additional comorbidities (p < 0.001); cohorts were similar regarding vasopressors, peak white blood cell counts, and rate of intensive care unit admissions. Mortality was lower among surgery patients (2.6% vs 6.8%; p = 0.028), and logistic regression demonstrated lower odds of mortality for this group OR = 0.18 (95% CI, 0.05-0.58)). After propensity score matching for age, comorbidities, and severity of disease, this difference was confirmed (2.6% vs. 9.5%). A higher incidence of total colectomy for surgery patients (14.2% vs 0.4%) was a causal factor in their longer lengths of stay and higher total hospital costs.

Therefore, in this study, we assessed the gene expression of identified lung lineage genes to study their role in distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma diversities. A total of 278 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas were included. Each case was evaluated for genetic mutations and histologic classification. Lineage genes associated with respiratory tract differentiation (NK2 homeobox 1 gene [NKX2-1], GATA protein binding 6 gene [GATA6], foxhead box J1 gene [FOXJ1], and SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor gene [SPDEF]) and stem/basal-like status (inhibitor of DNA binding 2, HLH protein gene [ID2], POU class 5 homeobox 1 gene [POU5F1], SRY-box 2 gene [SOX2], and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene [MYC]) were selected. mRNA expression of these genes in each tumor sample was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and normalized to paired normal lung tissue. Distinct lineage gene expressions were found on the basis of genetic and histologic diversities. Expression of NKX2-1, GATA6, FOXJ1, and POU5F1 exhibited a significant linear relationship across histologic subgroups that was independent of genetic mutation status. Expression levels of NKX2-1 and POU5F1 were also associated with EGFR mutation status, independent of histologic subtypes.

The irritative concentration of CoCl2 was determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit. VEGF production in ARPE-19 cells was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. The Wnt signaling pathway-associated molecules, including phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β), GSK3β, p-β-catenin and β-catenin, were detected with western blotting. pEGFP-N3-hTF was constructed and verified with digestion of the restriction enzyme and sequencing analysis. Human TF overexpression and silencing plasmids were transfected into the ARPE-19 cells to clarify the causal relationship between TF and VEGF expression. The Transwell coculture system of ARPE-19 cells and RF/6A rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial cells was performed to evaluate cell invasion and tube formation ability. Our anoxic model of ARPE-19 cells showed that TF expression was upregulated in accordance with variations in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and VEGF levels. Silencing and overexpression of TF decreased and increased VEGF expression, respectively. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway played an important role in this effect. Results from the ARPE-19 cell and RF/6A cell coculture system showed that the enhancement of TF expression in the ARPE-19 cells led to significantly faster invasion and stronger tube-forming ability of the RF/6A cells, while siRNA-mediated TF silencing caused the opposite effects.

{"query": "Do atlantic salmon populations reveal adaptive divergence of immune related genes - a duplicated genome under selection?", "topk": [{"text": "Populations of Atlantic salmon display highly significant genetic differences with unresolved molecular basis. These differences may result from separate postglacial colonization patterns, diversifying natural selection and adaptation, or a combination. Adaptation could be influenced or even facilitated by the recent whole genome duplication in the salmonid lineage which resulted in a partly tetraploid species with duplicated genes and regions. In order to elucidate the genes and genomic regions underlying the genetic differences, we conducted a genome wide association study using whole genome resequencing data from eight populations from Northern and Southern Norway. From a total of ~4.5 million sequencing-derived SNPs, more than 10 % showed significant differentiation between populations from these two regions and ten selective sweeps on chromosomes 5, 10, 11, 13-15, 21, 24 and 25 were identified. These comprised 59 genes, of which 15 had one or more differentiated missense mutation. Our analysis showed that most sweeps have paralogous regions in the partially tetraploid genome, each lacking the high number of significant SNPs found in the sweeps. The most significant sweep was found on Chr 25 and carried several missense mutations in the antiviral mx genes, suggesting that these populations have experienced differing viral pressures. Interestingly the second most significant sweep, found on Chr 5, contains two genes involved in the NF-KB pathway (nkap and nkrf), which is also a known pathogen target that controls a large number of processes in animals."}]}

We set to determine the role of toll-like receptor 3 and the binding of double-stranded RNA in the pathogenesis of sterile injury following lung contusion. Toll-like receptor 3 expression was analyzed in postmortem lung samples from patients with lung contusion. Unilateral lung contusion was induced in toll-like receptor 3 (-/-), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (-/-), and wild-type mice. Subsequently, lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Apoptotic indices, phagocytic activity, and phenotypic characterization of the macrophages were determined. Double-stranded RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum samples following lung contusion was measured. A toll-like receptor 3/double-stranded RNA ligand inhibitor was injected into wild-type mice prior to lung contusion. Toll-like receptor 3 expression was higher in patients and wild-type mice with lung contusion. The degree of lung injury, inflammation, and macrophage apoptosis was reduced in toll-like receptor 3 (-/-), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (-/-), and wild-type mice with toll-like receptor 3 antibody neutralization. Alveolar macrophages from toll-like receptor 3 (-/-) mice had a lower early apoptotic index, a predominant M2 phenotype and increased surface translocation of toll-like receptor 3 from the endosome to the surface. When compared with viral activation pathways, lung injury in lung contusion demonstrated increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation with inflammasome activation without a corresponding increase in nuclear factor-κB or type-1 interferon production. Additionally, pretreatment with toll-like receptor 3/double-stranded RNA ligand inhibitor led to a reduction in injury, inflammation, and macrophage apoptosis."}]}

Thirty-seven SLE females received 20 mg/day atorvastatin during eight weeks. At baseline, at the end of treatment and six months after atorvastatin withdrawal, disease activity, subclinical atherosclerosis -assessed by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) - and quantification of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) - as a surrogate biological marker of subclinical atherosclerosis - were carried out.

Sinonasal air-liquid interface cultures were treated with conditioned medium (CM) from lab strains and clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci and S aureus. NO production was quantified by fluorescence imaging. Bitter taste receptor signaling inhibitors were utilized to characterize the pathway responsible for NO production in response to S epidermidis CM. S epidermidis CM contains a low-molecular-weight, heat, and protease-stabile product that induces an NO synthase (NOS)-mediated NO production that is less robust than the response triggered by S aureus CM. The S epidermidis CM-stimulated NO response is not inhibited by antagonists of phospholipase C isoform β-2 nor the transient receptor potential melastatin isoform 5 ion channel, both critical to bitter taste signaling."}]}

This reference population (n = 818) covered three generations (G0, G1 and G2) and was genotyped with 4436 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We evaluated the effects on prediction accuracy of both the relatedness between the calibration and validation sets and validation on the basis of progeny performance. Pedigree-based (best linear unbiased prediction, ABLUP) and marker-based (genomic BLUP and Bayesian LASSO) models were used to predict breeding values for three different traits: circumference, height and stem straightness. On average, the ABLUP model outperformed genomic prediction models, with a maximum difference in prediction accuracies of 0.12, depending on the trait and the validation method. A mean difference in prediction accuracy of 0.17 was found between validation methods differing in terms of relatedness. Including the progenitors in the calibration set reduced this difference in prediction accuracy to 0.03. When only genotypes from the G0 and G1 generations were used in the calibration set and genotypes from G2 were used in the validation set (progeny validation), prediction accuracies ranged from 0.70 to 0.85."}]}

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of butyrate (in the form of butyrate glycerides, BG)-induced lipid metabolism at the level of gene expression in the jejunum and liver of broilers. Two animal experiments were included in this study. In Experiment 1, two hundred and forty male broiler chickens were equally allocated into two groups: 1) basal diet (BD), 2) BG diets (BD + BG). Growth performance was compared between treatments for the 41-day trial. In Experiment 2, forty male broiler chickens were equally allocated into two groups. The general experimental design, group and management were the same as described in Experiment 1 except for reduced bird numbers and 21-day duration of the trial. Growth performance, abdominal fat deposition, serum lipid profiles as well as serum and tissue concentrations of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were compared between treatments. RNA-seq was employed to identify both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and treatment specifically expressed genes (TSEGs). Functional clustering of DEGs and TSEGs and signaling pathways associated with lipid metabolism were identified using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (DAVID-BR). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were subsequently conducted to further examine the expression of genes in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway identified by DAVID-BR. Dietary BG intervention significantly reduced abdominal fat ratio (abdominal fat weight/final body weight) in broilers. The decreased fat deposition in BG-fed chickens was in accordance with serum lipid profiles as well as the level of lipid metabolism-related enzymes in the serum, abdominal adipose, jejunum and liver. RNA-seq analysis indicated that dietary BG intervention induced 79 and 205 characterized DEGs in the jejunum and liver, respectively. In addition, 255 and 165 TSEGs were detected in the liver and jejunum of BG-fed group, while 162 and 211 TSEGs genes were observed in the liver and jejunum of BD-fed birds, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis with both IPA and DAVID-BR further revealed a significant enrichment of DEGs and TSEGs in the biological processes for reducing the synthesis, storage, transportation and secretion of lipids in the jejunum, while those in the liver were for enhancing the oxidation of ingested lipids and fatty acids. In particular, transcriptional regulators of THRSP and EGR-1 as well as several DEGs involved in the PPAR-α signaling pathway were significantly induced by dietary BG intervention for lipid catabolism."}]}

{"query": "Is the transposable element environment of human genes associated with histone and expression changes in cancer?", "topk": [{"text": "Only 2 % of the human genome code for proteins. Among the remaining 98 %, transposable elements (TEs) represent millions of sequences. TEs have an impact on genome evolution by promoting mutations. Especially, TEs possess their own regulatory sequences and can alter the expression pattern of neighboring genes. Since they can potentially be harmful, TE activity is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. These mechanisms participate in the modulation of gene expression and can be associated with some human diseases resulting from gene expression deregulation. The fact that the TE silencing can be removed in cancer could explain a part of the changes in gene expression. Indeed, epigenetic modifications associated locally with TE sequences could impact neighboring genes since these modifications can spread to adjacent sequences. We compared the histone enrichment, TE neighborhood, and expression divergence of human genes between a normal and a cancer conditions. We show that the presence of TEs near genes is associated with greater changes in histone enrichment and that differentially expressed genes harbor larger histone enrichment variation related to the presence of particular TEs."}]}

However, the regulation and function of PNPLA3 in metabolic diseases remains unclear. Laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) of severely obese patients reduces body weight, liver and adipose tissue inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether weight loss induced by LAGB affected PNPLA3 expression in hepatic and adipose tissue. Liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected from 28 severely obese patients before and 6 months after LAGB. PNPLA3 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. To understand whether inflammatory stimuli regulated PNPLA3 expression, we studied the effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on PNPLA3 expression in human adipocytes and hepatocytes. PNPLA3 was strongly expressed in the liver and clearly detectable in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients. Weight loss induced by LAGB of severely obese patients led to significantly increased adipose, but not hepatic, tissue expression of PNPLA3. Subcutaneous PNPLA3 expression negatively correlated with body-mass-index, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. TNFα potently suppressed PNPLA3 expression in adipocytes but not hepatocytes."}]}

{"query": "Does haptoglobin or Hemopexin Therapy prevent Acute Adverse Effects of Resuscitation After Prolonged Storage of Red Cells?", "topk": [{"text": "Extracellular hemoglobin and cell-free heme are toxic breakdown products of hemolyzed erythrocytes. Mammals synthesize the scavenger proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin, which bind extracellular hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is a lifesaving therapy for patients with hemorrhagic shock. Because erythrocytes undergo progressive deleterious morphological and biochemical changes during storage, transfusion of packed red blood cells that have been stored for prolonged intervals (SRBCs; stored for 35-40 days in humans or 14 days in mice) increases plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin and heme. Therefore, in patients with hemorrhagic shock, perfusion-sensitive organs such as the kidneys are challenged not only by hypoperfusion but also by the high concentrations of plasma hemoglobin and heme that are associated with the transfusion of SRBCs. To test whether treatment with exogenous human haptoglobin or hemopexin can ameliorate adverse effects of resuscitation with SRBCs after 2 hours of hemorrhagic shock, mice that received SRBCs were given a coinfusion of haptoglobin, hemopexin, or albumin. Treatment with haptoglobin or hemopexin but not albumin improved the survival rate and attenuated SRBC-induced inflammation.

One of the receptors responsible for the transport of Aβ in the BBB is the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). LRP1 is susceptible to proteolytic shedding at the cell surface, which prevents endocytic transport of ligands. Previously, we reported a strong inverse correlation between LRP1 shedding in the brain and Aβ transit across the BBB. Several proteases contribute to the ectodomain shedding of LRP1 including the α-secretase, a desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein 10 (ADAM10). The role of ADAM10 in the shedding of LRP1 and Aβ BBB clearance was assessed through pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 in an in vitro model of the BBB and through the use of ADAM10 endothelial specific knock-out mice. In addition, an acute treatment paradigm with an ADAM10 inhibitor was also tested in an AD mouse model to assess the effect of ADAM10 inhibition on LRP1 shedding and Aβbrain accumulation. In the current studies, inhibition of ADAM10 reduced LRP1 shedding in brain endothelial cultures and increased Aβ42 transit across an in vitro model of the BBB. Similarly, transgenic ADAM10 endothelial knockout mice displayed lower LRP1 shedding in the brain and significantly enhanced Aβ clearance across the BBB compared to wild-type animals. Acute treatment with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X in an AD mouse model substantially reduced brain LRP1 shedding and increased Aβ40 levels in the plasma, indicating enhanced Aβ transit from the brain to the periphery.

All the men underwent detailed clinical evaluations. PSA mass density was calculated (serum PSA level × plasma volume ÷ prostate volume) for simultaneously adjusting plasma volume and prostate volume. According to the modified National Cholesterol Education Programme-Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III criteria, patients were dichotomized by the presence of MetS, and differences in PSA density and PSA mass density were compared between groups. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of MetS on serum PSA levels. When larger prostate volume in men with MetS was adjusted for, both PSA density and PSA mass density in men with MetS were significantly lower than in men without MetS, and the estimated difference in mean serum PSA level between men with and without MetS was greater than that before adjusting for prostate volume. In the multivariate regression model, the presence of MetS was independently associated with an 11.3% decline in serum PSA levels compared with the absence of MetS. In addition, increasing number of positive MetS components was significantly and linearly associated with decline in serum PSA levels."}]}

The objective of the research was to examine the connection of serum inflammatory parameters and ultrasound (US) characteristics of the structure and size of carotid plaque. We assumed that the number of leukocytes (Le) was an indicator of carotid plaque instability and an increased risk of stroke. Serum inflammatory parameters: erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the first (ESR I) and second hour (ESR II), the number of Le, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen were measured by standard methods. All the subjects (n = 75) were divided into 3 groups (symptomatic, asymptomatic and control). US evaluation of extracranial carotid arteries was performed in a duplex system. Plaques were classified into categories according to stenosis percentage (≥ 50%, < 50%) and pursuant to echomorphological characteristics (Gray-Weale classification). In the subjects with stroke an ischemic lesion was confirmed by computed tomography. The average values of biochemical parameters in the symptomatic group were: ESR I 29.57 ± 29.87 cm, ESR II 51.60 ± 36.87 cm, the number of Le 10.10 ± 3.20 x 10⁹ U/L, hsCRP 8.15 ± 5.50 mg/L and fibrinogen 4.03 ± 0.70 g/L. The average values of all testing biochemical parameters in symptomatic patients were significantly higher than in the asymptomatic ones and the control group: for ESR I (p < 0.05) and ESR II (p < 0.05); for the number of Le (p < 0.001); for hsCRP (p < 0.001) and fibrinogen (p < 0.001). Category I of echomorphological characteristics in the symptomatic group was present in 66.7% of the cases and it was significantly higher than in the asymptomatic (40.0%; p < 0.05) and the control group (20.0%; p < 0.01). Univariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that all testing biochemical parameters are indicators of stroke risk.

Epigenetic alterations are suggested to play a pivotal role in modulating the phenotypic expression of CHDs and their clinical course during life. Candidate approaches implied that DNA methylation might have a developmental role in CHD and contributes to the long-term progress of non-structural cardiac diseases. The aim of the present study is to define the postnatal epigenome of two common cardiac malformations, representing epigenetic memory, and adaption to hemodynamic alterations, which are jointly relevant for the disease course. We present the first analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data obtained from myocardial biopsies of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and ventricular septal defect patients. We defined stringent sets of differentially methylated regions between patients and controls, which are significantly enriched for genomic features like promoters, exons, and cardiac enhancers. For TOF, we linked DNA methylation with genome-wide expression data and found a significant overlap for hypermethylated promoters and down-regulated genes, and vice versa. We validated and replicated the methylation of selected CpGs and performed functional assays. We identified a hypermethylated novel developmental CpG island in the promoter of SCO2 and demonstrate its functional impact. Moreover, we discovered methylation changes co-localized with novel, differential splicing events among sarcomeric genes as well as transcription factor binding sites. Finally, we demonstrated the interaction of differentially methylated and expressed genes in TOF with mutated CHD genes in a molecular network."}]}

Multiple costamere-associated proteins, such as integrins and integrin-interacting proteins, have been identified and shown to play an increasingly important role in the pathogenesis of human cardiomyopathy. Kindlin-2 is an adaptor protein that binds to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail to promote integrin activation. Genetic deficiency of Kindlin-2 results in embryonic lethality, and knockdown of the Kindlin-2 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio suggests that it has an essential role in integrin function and normal muscle structure and function. The precise role of Kindlin-2 in the mammalian cardiac myocyte remains to be determined. The current studies were designed to investigate the role of Kindlin-2 in the mammalian heart. We generated a series of cardiac myocyte-specific Kindlin-2 knockout mice with excision of the Kindlin-2 gene in either developing or adult cardiac myocytes. We found that mice lacking Kindlin-2 in the early developing heart are embryonic lethal. We demonstrate that deletion of Kindlin-2 at late gestation or in adult cardiac myocytes resulted in heart failure and premature death, which were associated with enlargement of the heart and extensive fibrosis. In addition, integrin β1D protein expression was significantly downregulated in the adult heart."}]}

In vivo localization of Indium-111-labeled E.coli asparaginase was carried out in C57Bl/6 mice by both microSPECT/CT and by ex vivo biodistribution studies. Mice were treated with liposomal clodronate to investigate the effect of macrophage depletion on tracer localization and drug clearance in vivo. Moreover, macrophage cell line models RAW264.7 and THP-1, as well as cathepsin B deficient mice, were used to identify the cellular and molecular components controlling asparaginase pharmacokinetics. In vivo imaging and biodistribution studies showed a rapid accumulation of asparaginase in macrophage-rich tissues such as liver, spleen and in particular bone marrow. Clodronate-mediated depletion of phagocytic cells markedly prolonged the serum half-life of asparaginase in vivo and decreased drug uptake in target organs. Immunohistochemistry and in vitro binding assays confirmed the involvement of macrophage-like cells in the uptake of asparaginase. We identified the activity of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B in macrophages as a rate-limiting factor in degrading asparaginase both in vitro and in vivo."}]}

Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was recently discovered to be a marker for gastrointestinal CSCs. Here, we aimed to explore whether DCLK1 is associated with CRC metastasis through clinical and in vitro investigations. The expression levels of DCLK1 mRNA and protein in human CRC tissues were analyzed through quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining, respectively. Human CRC cell line SW480 was selected to explore the effect of DCLK1 overexpression on cell migration and invasion. Besides, the associations between DCLK1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were determined. Compared to normal colorectal tissues, DCLK1 expression was significantly up-regulated in human CRC tissues and correlated well with high lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis in patients. DCLK1 expression was inversely associated with overall survival in CRC patients. Overexpression of DCLK1 in SW480 cells markedly promoted cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we validated that DCLK1 could facilitate EMT in cancer cells by up-regulation of the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and ZEB1 and down-regulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in SW480 cells."}]}

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been developed into a model for identifying and understanding these pathways. Recently, it was reported that UNC-105/degenerin channel activation produced muscle protein degradation via an unknown mechanism. Generation of transgenic and double mutant C. elegans, RNAi, and drug treatments were utilized to assess molecular events governing protein degradation. Western blots were used to measure protein content. Cationic dyes and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production assays were utilized to measure mitochondrial function. unc-105 gain-of-function mutants display aberrant muscle protein degradation and a movement defect; both are reduced in intragenic revertants and in let-2 mutants that gate the hyperactive UNC-105 channel. Degradation is not suppressed by interventions suppressing proteasome-mediated, autophagy-mediated, or calpain-mediated degradation nor by suppressors of degenerin-induced neurodegeneration. Protein degradation, but not the movement defect, is decreased by treatment with caspase inhibitors or RNAi against ced-3 or ced-4. Adult unc-105 muscles display a time-dependent fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum that is associated with impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and that correlates with decreased rates of maximal ATP production. Reduced levels of CED-4, which is sufficient to activate CED-3 in vitro, are observed in unc-105 mitochondrial isolations."}]}

A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), coupled with effective therapeutic approaches, will improve management of progressive functional impairment in cancer patients. Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside in Rhodiola rosea L, has been reported to possess potential anti-fatigue, anti-ageing, and anti-Alzheimer's disease properties. It is widely consumed as a nutritional supplement, but its effects on CAC and the possible mechanism remain a mystery. In the murine models of cachexia induced by CT-26 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour, respectively, main features of CAC were determined after treatment of salidroside or chemotherapy. In vitro experiments were performed using murine C2C12 myotubes, which were treated by tumour necrosis factor-α. Levels of several critical muscle-related signal proteins such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) were examined using western blot both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we showed the exciting effect of salidroside on the treatment of CAC. In CT-26 and LLC models, respectively, salidroside treatment could effectively preserve the tumour-free body weight, decrease loss of adipose and gastrocnemius muscles, alleviate tumour burden, and prolong their survival time. Additionally, in combined chemotherapy, salidroside could synergistically enhance the anti-tumour activity of cisplatin, especially decreased or eliminated chemotherapy-induced cachexia. Further analysis demonstrated that salidroside could significantly increase expression of mTOR, p-mTOR, and MyHC in gastrocnemius muscle. Also, results in vitro showed that salidroside could not only obviously increase mTOR, p-mTOR, and MyHC expression in C2C12 myotubes but also effectively rescue their down-regulation induced by tumour necrosis factor-α."}]}

In this study, the expression of RACK1 was evaluated by Western blot analysis in 8 paired fresh PDAC tissues and immunohistochemistry on 179 paraffin-embedded slices. Then, we used Fisher exact test to analyze the correlation between RACK1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Starvation and re-feeding assay was used to assess cell cycle. Western blot, CCK8, flow cytometry assays, and colony formation analyses demonstrated that RACK1 played an essential role in PDAC development. Annexin-V/PI apoptotic assay and western blot showed that RACK1 was involved in regulating the apoptosis of PDAC cells. RACK1 was highly expressed in PDAC tissues and cell lines and was significantly associated with multiple clinicopathological factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high RACK1 expression was identified to be an independent prognostic factor for PDAC patients' survival. In vitro, serum starvation-refeeding experiment suggested that RACK1 was upregulated in proliferating PDAC cells, together with the percentage of cells at the S phase, and was correlated with the expression of Cyclin D1. Moreover, Overexpression of RACK1 facilitated the proliferation and cell cycle progression of PDAC cells, while downregulation of RACK1 induced growth impairment, G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PDAC cells.

We conducted a prospective two-period study using data from the French pneumonia network that included all children with CAP, aged one month to 15 years old, admitted to one of the ten participating paediatric emergency departments. In the first period, data from children included in all ten centres were analysed. In the second period, we analysed children in three centers for which we collected additional data. Two experts assessed compliance with the current French recommendations. Independent determinants of non-compliance were evaluated using a logistic regression model. The frequency of non-compliance was compared between the two periods for the same centres in univariate analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors. A total of 3034 children were included during the first period (from May 2009 to May 2011) and 293 in the second period (from January to July 2012). Median ages were 3.0 years [1.4-5] in the first period and 3.6 years in the second period. The main reasons for non-compliance were the improper use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. Factors that were independently associated with non-compliance with recommendations were younger age, presence of risk factors for pneumococcal infection, and hospitalization. We also observed significant differences in compliance between the treatment centres during the first period. The frequency of non-compliance significantly decreased from 48 to 18.8 % between 2009 and 2012. The association between period and non-compliance remained statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Amoxicillin was prescribed as the sole therapy significantly more frequently in the second period (71 % vs. 54.2 %, p < 0.001)."}]}
{"query": "Is bnPME progressively induced after microspore reprogramming to embryogenesis , correlating with pectin de-esterification and cell differentiation in Brassica napus?", "topk": [{"text": "Pectins are one of the main components of plant cell walls. They are secreted to the wall as highly methylesterified forms that can be de-esterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). The degree of methylesterification of pectins changes during development, PMEs are involved in the cell wall remodeling that occurs during diverse plant developmental processes. Nevertheless, the functional meaning of pectin-related wall remodeling in different cell types and processes remains unclear. In vivo, the microspore follows the gametophytic pathway and differentiates to form the pollen grain. In vitro, the microspore can be reprogrammed by stress treatments becoming a totipotent cell that starts to proliferate and follows the embryogenic pathway, a process known as microspore embryogenesis. To investigate if the change of developmental programme of the microspore towards embryogenesis involves changes in pectin esterification levels, which would cause the cell wall remodeling during the process, in the present study, dynamics of PME expression and degrees of pectin esterification have been analysed during microspore embryogenesis and compared with the gametophytic development, in Brassica napus. A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted including BnPME gene expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, immuno-dot-blot and immunofluorescence with JIM5 and JIM7 antibodies to reveal low and highly-methylesterified pectins. The results showed that cell differentiation at advanced developmental stages involved induction of BnPME expression and pectin de-esterification, processes that were also detected in zygotic embryos, providing additional evidence that microspore embryogenesis mimics zygotic embryogenesis. By contrast, early microspore embryogenesis, totipotency and proliferation were associated with low expression of BnPME and high levels of esterified pectins."}]}

Cell morphology and phosphatidylserine externalization were visualized after Giemsa-May-Grunwald and annexin V staining, respectively. DNA content and mitochondrial depolarization were measured by flow cytometry. BAX and BCL-xL expression was examined by RT-PCR. NFP was 3.8-fold more cytotoxic against HL-60 leukemia cells than against normal cells. NFP reduced the number of viable cells 24h after the treatment with a concomitant increase in the number of apoptotic cells indicated by the externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial depolarization.

In total, 24 rabbits were divided into control (standard diet), high-lipid diet (HLD), and PUE (HLD supplemented with puerarin) groups. At the end of weeks 0, 8, and 16, serum levels of AMs were measured. At the end of week 16, the thickness of the intima was detected. Protein and mRNA levels of AMs were checked by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively. Protein levels of p65 NF-κB and phosphorylation of inhibitor-κB (I-κB) were investigated by Western blotting. Atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic arch were found in the HLD and PUE groups, but not in the control group. Compared with the HLD group, the thickness of the intima in the PUE group was reduced. Our results indicate that puerarin reduced the protein and mRNA levels of AMs in this rabbit model. We also found that the reduced AM levels were due to inhibition of the phosphorylation and degradation of I-κB, resulting in reduced p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation."}]}
{"query": "Does comprehensive repeatome annotation reveal strong potential impact of repetitive elements on tomato ripening?", "topk": [{"text": "Plant genomes are populated by different types of repetitive elements including transposable elements (TEs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that can have a strong impact on genome size and dynamic as well as on the regulation of gene transcription. At least two-thirds of the tomato genome is composed of repeats. While their bulk impact on genome organization has been recently revealed by whole genome assembly, their influence on tomato biology and phenotype remains largely unaddressed. More specifically, the effects and roles of DNA repeats on the maturation of fleshy fruits, which is a complex process of key agro-economic interest, still needs to be investigated comprehensively and tomato is arguably an excellent model for such study. We have performed a comprehensive annotation of the tomato repeatome to explore its potential impact on tomato genome composition and gene transcription. Our results show that the tomato genome can be fractioned into three compartments with different gene and repeat density, each compartment presenting contrasting repeat and gene composition, repeat-gene associations and different gene transcriptional levels. In the context of fruit ripening, we found that repeats are present in the majority of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and thousands of repeat-associated DMRs are found in gene proximity including hundreds that are differentially regulated. Furthermore, we found that repeats are also present in the proximity of binding sites of the key ripening protein RIN. We also observed that some repeat families are present at unexpected high frequency in the proximity of genes that are differentially expressed during tomato ripening."}]}

{"query": "Does natal habitat imprinting counteract the diversifying effects of phenotype-dependent dispersal in a spatially structured population?", "topk": [{"text": "Habitat selection may have profound evolutionary consequences, but they strongly depend on the underlying preference mechanism, including genetically-determined, natal habitat and phenotype-dependent preferences. It is known that different mechanisms may operate at the same time, yet their relative contribution to population differentiation remains largely unexplored empirically mainly because of the difficulty of finding suitable study systems. Here, we investigate the role of early experience and genetic background in determining the outcome of settlement by pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding in two habitat patches between which dispersal and subsequent reproductive performance is influenced by phenotype (body size). For this, we conducted a cross-fostering experiment in a two-patch system: an oakwood and a conifer plantation separated by only 1 km. Experimental birds mostly returned to breed in the forest patch where they were raised, whether it was that of their genetic or their foster parents, indicating that decisions on where to settle are determined by individuals' experience in their natal site, rather than by their genetic background. Nevertheless, nearly a third (27.6 %) moved away from the rearing habitat and, as previously observed in unmanipulated individuals, dispersal between habitats was phenotype-dependent. Pied flycatchers breeding in the oak and the pine forests are differentiated by body size, and analyses of genetic variation at microsatellite loci now provide evidence of subtle genetic differentiation between the two populations. This suggests that phenotype-dependent dispersal may contribute to population structure despite the short distance and widespread exchange of birds between the study plots."}]}

We investigate the role of AngII-induced mir-21 in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1β axis in liver fibrosis. In vivo, circulating mir-21 was upregulated in patients with liver fibrosis and was positively correlated with liver fibrosis and oxidation. Treatment with Ang-(1-7) inhibited mir-21, NLRP3 inflammasome, and liver fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL) or AngII infusion. Inhibition of mir-21 suppressed the Smad7/Smad2/3/NOX4, Spry1/ERK/NF-κB pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome, and liver fibrosis induced by AngII infusion. In vitro, AngII upregulated mir-21 expression via targeting Smad7 and Spry1 in primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In contrast, Ang-(1-7) suppressed mir-21 expression and oxidation induced by AngII. Overexpression of mir-21 promoted oxidation, and collagen production enhanced the effect of AngII on NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the Spry1/ERK/NF-κB, Smad7/Smad2/3/NOX4 pathways.

{"query": "Does systemic-Pulmonary Shunt facilitate the Growth of the Pulmonary Valve Annulus in Patients With Tetralogy of Fallot?", "topk": [{"text": "Transannular patching (TAP) frequently accompanies primary repairs (PRs) in symptomatic neonates with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). If a systemic-pulmonary shunt (SPS) facilitates the growth of the pulmonary valve annulus (PVA), patients with a marginally small PVA could benefit from a staged repair in terms of lowering the risk of TAP. Among 216 infants with TOF who underwent surgical intervention between January 2004 and December 2013, 29 infants underwent SPS with a subsequent repair (SPS group), whereas 187 infants received a PR (PR group). Median age and the Z-score of the PVA (PVA [Z]) at SPS were 32 days and -3.5, respectively. There was one late death and one follow-up loss after SPS, and preservation of the PVA was achieved on repair in 16 patients (16 of 29; 55%). Multiple regression analysis showed that performance of SPS was the only indicator of the increase in the PVA (Z) in the entire cohort (n = 216). On mixed linear regression, the PVA (Z) increased significantly after the placement of an SPS (-3.6 + 0.2*duration in months, p = 0.001), whereas the prerepair changes in the PVA (Z) were not statistically significant in the PR group (p = 0.7), with a significant intergroup difference (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that placement of TAP is expected when the preshunt PVA (Z) is smaller than -4.2 (area under the curve: 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.62 to 1.00; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 73%)."}]}
{"query": "Is diagnostic Ureteroscopy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Independently Associated with Intravesical Recurrence after Radical Nephroureterectomy?", "topk": [{"text": "To determine the effect of diagnostic ureteroscopy on intravesical recurrence in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) after radical nephroureterec¬tomy (RNU). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 664 patients who were treated with RNU for UTUC from June 2000 to December 2011, excluding those who had concomitant/prior bladder tumors. Of the 664 patients, 81 underwent di¬agnostic ureteroscopy (URS). We analyzed the impact of diagnostic ureteroscopy on intravesical recurrence (IVR) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multi¬variate analyses were used to determine the independent risk factors. The median follow-up time was 48 months (interquartile range (IQR): 31- 77 months). Patients who underwent ureteroscopy were more likely to have a small (p<0.01), early-staged (p=0.019), multifocality (p=0.035) and ureteral tumor (p<0.001). IVR occurred in 223 patients during follow-up within a median of 17 months (IQR: 7-33). Patients without preoperative ureteroscopy have a statistically significant better 2-year (79.3%±0.02 versus 71.4%±0.02, p<0.001) and 5-year intravesical recurrence-free survival rates (64.9%±0.05 versus 44.3%±0.06, p<0.001) than patients who un¬derwent ureteroscopy. In multivariate analysis, the diagnostic ureteroscopy (p=0.006), multiple tumors (p=0.001), tumor size <3cm (p=0.008), low-grade (p=0.022) and pN0 stage tumor (p=0.045) were independent predictors of IVR."}]}
{"query": "Is progression of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma driven by alveolar macrophages?", "topk": [{"text": "Lung adenocarcinomas with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have unprecedented initial responses to targeted therapy against the EGFR. Over time, however, these tumors invariably develop resistance to these drugs. We set out to investigate alternative treatment approaches for these tumors. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, we utilized a bi-transgenic mouse model in which a mutant human EGFR gene is selectively expressed in the lungs. EGFR oncogene-dependent progression and remission of lung adenocarcinoma was respectively dependent upon the expansion and contraction of alveolar macrophages, and the mechanism underlying macrophage expansion was local proliferation. In tumor-bearing mice, alveolar macrophages downregulated surface expression of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules; increased production of CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-1RA; and increased phagocytosis. Depletion of alveolar macrophages in tumor-bearing mice resulted in reduction of tumor burden, indicating a critical role for these cells in the development of EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma. Treatment of mice with EGFR targeting clinical drugs (erlotinib and cetuximab) resulted in a significant decrease in alveolar macrophages in these mice. An activated alveolar macrophage mRNA signature was dominant in human EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinomas, and the presence of this alveolar macrophage activation signature was associated with unfavorable survival among patients undergoing resection for EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma."}]}
{"query": "Is hyperglycemia associated with increased risk of patient delay in pulmonary tuberculosis in rural areas?", "topk": [{"text": "Excessive time between the first presentation of symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and diagnosis contributes to ongoing transmission and increased risk of infection in the community, as well as to increased disease severity and higher mortality. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a higher risk of developing PTB. However, the effect of T2DM on delayed diagnosis of PTB is not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of hyperglycemia (diabetes and prediabetes) and other factors on PTB patient delay in a rural area of China. In the present community-based investigation, PTB patients aged ≥16 years newly diagnosed at county tuberculosis dispensaries were recruited consecutively between September 2011 and December 2013. Fasting blood glucose was determined in all subjects, and a structured questionnaire was used to collect basic information. Of the 2280 patients, 605 (26.5 %) had hyperglycemia. The median (interquartile range) time to seeking health care was 44 (59) days. Health care seeking was delayed in 1754 subjects, and hyperglycemia was independently associated with an increased probability (odds ratio 2.10; 95 % confidence interval 1.49-2.97) of patient delay in subjects aged ≥30 years. Other factors associated with patient delay were cough, night sweats, and lack of knowledge regarding typical tuberculosis symptoms. The onset of hemoptysis was negatively correlated with patient delay."}]}
{"query": "Is oral decontamination with aminoglycosides associated with lower risk of mortality and infections in high-risk patients colonized with colistin-resistant , KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae?", "topk": [{"text": "Invasive infections caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPCKP) are associated with very high mortality. Because infection is usually preceded by rectal colonization, we investigated if decolonization therapy (DT) with aminoglycosides had a protective effect in selected patients. Patients with rectal colonization by colistin-resistant KPCKP who were at high risk of developing infection (because of neutropenia, surgery, previous recurrent KPCKP infections or multiple comorbidities) were followed for 180 days. Cox regression analysis including a propensity score was used to investigate the impact of the use of two intestinal decolonization regimens with oral aminoglycosides (gentamicin and neomycin/streptomycin) on mortality, risk of KPCKP infections and microbiological success. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02604849). The study sample comprised 77 colonized patients, of which 44 (57.1%) received DT. At 180 days of follow-up, decolonization was associated with a lower risk of mortality in multivariate analyses (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.06-0.55) and a lower risk of KPCKP infections (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02-0.83) and increased microbiological success (HR 4.06; 95% CI 1.06-15.6). Specifically, gentamicin oral therapy was associated with a lower risk of crude mortality (HR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04-0.54), a lower risk of KPCKP infections (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.008-0.94) and increased microbiological response at 180 days of follow-up (HR 5.67; 95% CI 1.33-24.1). Neomycin/streptomycin therapy was only associated with a lower risk of crude mortality (HR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06-0.9)."}]}
{"query": "Does mST1 coordinately regulate autophagy and apoptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice?", "topk": [{"text": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is associated with suppressed autophagy and augmented apoptosis in the heart although the interplay between the two remains elusive. The ability of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 to regulate both autophagy and apoptosis prompted us to investigate it as a possible candidate in the progression of DCM. Wild-type, Mst1 (also known as Stk4) transgenic and Mst1-knockout mice were challenged with streptozotocin to induce experimental diabetes. In addition, cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were subjected to simulated diabetes to probe mechanisms. Mst1 knockout alleviated while Mst1 overexpression aggravated cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. Diabetic Mst1 transgenic mice exhibited decreased LC3 expression and enhanced protein aggregation. In contrast, typical autophagosomes were observed in diabetic Mst1-knockout mice with increased LC3 expression and reduced protein aggregation. Mst1 downregulation promoted autophagic flux as demonstrated by increased LC3-II and decreased p62 expression in the presence of bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, Mst1 overexpression increased, while Mst1 knockout decreased, cardiomyocyte apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Mst1 overexpression promoted Beclin1 binding to B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and induced dissociation of Bcl-2 from Bax in diabetic mice. Conversely, Mst1 knockout disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex and enhanced the interaction between Bcl-2 and Bax."}]}
{"query": "Does sulforaphane prevent Neuronal Apoptosis and Memory Impairment in Diabetic Rats?", "topk": [{"text": "To explore the effects of sulforaphane (SFN) on neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus and memory impairment in diabetic rats. Thirty male rats were randomly divided into normal control, diabetic model and SFN treatment groups (N = 10 in each group). Streptozotocin (STZ) was applied to establish diabetic model. Water Morris maze task was applied to test learning and memory. Tunel assaying was used to detect apoptosis in hippocampus. The expressions of Caspase-3 and myeloid cell leukemia 1(MCL-1) were detected by western blotting. Neurotrophic factor levels and AKT/GSK3β pathway were also detected. Compared with normal control, learning and memory were apparently impaired, with up-regulation of Caspase-3 and down-regulation of MCL-1 in diabetic rats. Apoptotic neurons were also found in CA1 region after diabetic modeling. By contrast, SFN treatment prevented the memory impairment, decreased the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. SFN also attenuated the abnormal expression of Caspase-3 and MCL-1 in diabetic model. Mechanically, SFN treatment reversed diabetic modeling-induced decrease of p-Akt, p-GSK3β, NGF and BDNF expressions."}]}
