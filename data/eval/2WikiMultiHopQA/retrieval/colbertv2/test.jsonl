Jean Rouch (31 May 1917 – 18 February 2004) was a French filmmaker and anthropologist. He is considered to be one of the founders of cinéma vérité in France. Rouch's practice as a filmmaker, for over sixty years in Africa, was characterized by the idea of \"shared anthropology\". Influenced by his discovery of surrealism in his early twenties, many of his films blur the line between fiction and documentary, creating a new style: ethnofiction. He was hailed by the French New Wave filmmakers as one of their own. His seminal film \"Me a BlackMoi, un noir\") pioneered the technique of jump cut popularized by Jean-Luc Godard. Commenting Rouch's work, someone \"in charge of research for the Musée de l'Homme\" in Paris, Godard questioned: “Is there a better definition for a filmmaker?\"."}]}

His father, a retired judge, destined him for the legal profession, but the boy's tastes pointed definitely in another direction. Even at school he was remarked for his wonderful skill in drawing and painting, and in 1812 he was permitted to visit Paris in order to perfect his art. Begas studied for eighteen months in the atelier of Antoine Jean Gros then began to work independently. In 1814 his copy of\" The Madonna della Sedia\" was bought by the king of Prussia, who was attracted by the young artist and did much to advance him. He was engaged to paint several large Biblical pictures, and in 1825, after his return from Italy, continued to produce paintings which were placed in the churches of Berlin and Potsdam. Some of these were historical pieces, but the majority were representations of scenes from the Bible. Begas was also celebrated as a portrait- painter, and supplied to the royal gallery a long series of portraits of eminent Prussian men of letters. His pupils included Joseph Petzl. At his death he held the post of court painter at Berlin. Anne van Olst( born 25 March 1962 in Aalborg, Nordjylland), also known as Anne Koch Jensen, is a Danish dressage rider.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"TaxmanWithin You Without YouWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHere Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978. Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. \" Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million. \"Hari's on Tour (Express)\" is an instrumental by English musician George Harrison, released as the opening track of his 1974 album \"Dark Horse\".

Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, the track is the first of only two genuine instrumentals he released from 1970 onwards – the other being the Grammy Award-winning \"Marwa Blues\", from his 2002 album \"Brainwashed\". Harrison recorded \"Hari's on Tour\" in April 1974 at a spontaneous session held at his home, Friar Park. A slide guitar-based composition, the track also features saxophonist Tom Scott and the latter's jazz-rock band L.A. Express, who were touring as Joni Mitchell's backing group at the time. It was the first Harrison song to feature Scott, who became a regular collaborator and served as band leader during Harrison's only series of concerts in North America, the highly publicised \"Dark Horse Tour\" with Ravi Shankar. \" Hari's on Tour (Express)\" was played as the opening number throughout this tour, over November and December 1974. Although music critics and Harrison biographers have generally viewed the album track in an unfavourable light, several concert reviewers identified it as an effective opener for the shows. \"Hari's on Tour\" is one of only two songs from the 1974 tour to have been released officially, after a live version was included on the limited-edition \"Songs by George Harrison 2\" EP in 1992. This live recording was taken from the Washington, DC stop on the tour, during which Harrison met with President Gerald Ford at the White House."}]}

Graf was born in Nuremberg on November 23, 1901 and studied at botanic gardens in Vienna and took courses in botany, photography and language throughout Europe, in California and at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He came to work on a ranch in Nebraska in the 1920s and later established a floral shop in Sioux City, Iowa that failed after his greenhouse was demolished as the result of a hailstorm. He found a position in 1931 with the Julius Roehrs Company, a tropical nursery in New Jersey, where his experience growing orchids in his youth in Germany helped him tap into what was becoming a major field of interest in the U.S. With his position at Roehrs, his travels allowed him to bring back new species that the company could add to its catalog, which morphed into book form as the\" Exotic Plant Manual\", complete with 7,000 photos. Graf's writings were based on firsthand research done on travels around the world, having visited sites of plants that could be found on Mount Kilimanjaro, in New Guinea and throughout China, India and much of Asia, uncovering scores of previously undocumented species which he introduced to Western plant aficionados and carefully documented with his camera. Among his findings were the first known white African Violet. His books typically included thousands of his photographs and were priced accordingly. Roehrs Publishing released\" Exotica: Pictorial Cyclopedia of Indoor Plants\" in 1958 with in excess of 4,000 images, a guide to imported plants and the steps needed to grow them, his first book to receive widespread attention.

He worked for a while at Edison's studio, then started his own production company, being quite successful financially, although most of his films are little known today. When critics began to regard the films of his day to be immoral, Searley became one of the founding members of the MPDA (Motion Picture Directors Association) which sought to give filmmakers who advocated good taste the power of self-censorship."}]}

Narathihapate (also Sithu IV of Pagan; 23 April 1238 – 1 July 1287) was the last king of the Pagan Empire who reigned from 1256 to 1287. The king is known in Burmese history as the \"Taruk-Pyay Minthe King who Fled from the Taruk [Mongols]\") for his flight from Pagan (Bagan) to Lower Burma in 1285 during the first Mongol invasion (1277–87) of the kingdom. He eventually submitted to Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty in January 1287 in exchange for a Mongol withdrawal from northern Burma. But when the king was assassinated six months later by his son Thihathu, the Viceroy of Prome, the 250-year-old Pagan Empire broke apart into multiple petty states. The political fragmentation of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery would last for another 250 years until the mid-16th century. The king is unkindly remembered in the royal chronicles, which in addition to calling a cowardly king who fled from the invaders, also call him \"an ogre\" and \"glutton\" who was \"great in wrath, haughtiness and envy, exceeding covetous and ambitious.\" According to scholarship, he was certainly an ineffective ruler but unfairly scapegoated by the chronicles for the fall of the empire, whose decline predated his reign, and in fact had been \"more prolonged and agonized\"."}]}

A Song for Tomorrow is a 1948 second feature drama film directed by Terence Fisher in his directorial debut. It stars Evelyn Maccabe and Ralph Michael. The screenplay concerns a World War II fighter pilot who suffers amnesia. It was made at Highbury Studios as a second feature. The Belgian is a 1917 American silent film directed by Sidney Olcott and produced by Sidney Olcott Players with Valentine Grant and Walker Whiteside in the leading roles. It is not known whether the film currently survives. Terence Fisher( 23 February 1904 – 18 June 1980) was a British film director best known for his work for Hammer Films. He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour, and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films, while mild by modern standards, were unprecedented in his day. His first major gothic horror film was\" The Curse of Frankenstein\"( 1957), which launched Hammer's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects, including\" Dracula\"( 1958),\" The Mummy\"( 1959), and\" The Curse of the Werewolf\"( 1961). Given their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher's films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an\" auteur\" in his own right. His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality, morality, and ‘ the charm of evil ’. Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook, there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason, in contrast to other characters, who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold, godless rationalism. For detailed discussions of Fisher's work, see\" Terence Fisher: Horror, Myth, and Religion\" by Paul Leggett( McFarland and Co, 2002),\" British Film Makers: Terence Fisher\" by Peter Hutchings( Manchester University Press, 2013), and\" The Films of Terence Fisher: Hammer Horror and Beyond\" by Wheeler Winston Dixon( Auteur Publishing, 2017)."}]}

The Velvet Underground was not a commercial success during its existence, but became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. After leaving the band in 1970, Reed released twenty solo studio albums. His second, \"Transformer\" (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought mainstream recognition. After \"Transformer\", the less commercial \"Berlin\" reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\" (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and \"Sally Can't Dance\" (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with \"New Sensations\" (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album \"New York\". Reed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled \"Songs for Drella\" which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. \" Magic and Loss\" (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.

He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album \"Lulu\" with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic lyrics and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.

Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the \"Louisiana Hayride\" radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987).

Although his music did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, he gradually achieved wider recognition and is now considered among the most influential English singer-songwriters of the last 50 years. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and released his debut album, \"Five Leaves Left\", in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums: \"Bryter Layter\" and \"Pink Moon\". Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. Drake's reluctance to perform live or be interviewed contributed to his lack of commercial success. He suffered from depression and insomnia, topics often reflected in his lyrics. After completing \"Pink Moon\" in 1972, he withdrew from live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, at the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of amitriptyline, a prescribed antidepressant. The 1979 release of the retrospective album \"Fruit Tree\" triggered a reassessment of Drake's catalogue. By the mid-1980s, artists such as Robert Smith, David Sylvian and Peter Buck were crediting Drake as an influence. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \"Life in a Northern Town\", dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, Drake had come to represent the \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press, and was being cited by artists including Kate Bush, Paul Weller and the Black Crowes. The first Drake biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary \"A Stranger Among Us\". In 2000, the title track from \"Pink Moon\" appeared in a Volkswagen advertisement, and within a month Drake had sold more records than he had in the previous 30 years. \"Magic\" (also known as \"I Was Made to Love Magic\") is the second listed song from Nick Drake's 2004 compilation album \"Made to Love Magic\" and was remastered and released as a single in 2004. The single was released on both CD and vinyl record formats with \"Bryter Layter\" track \"Northern Sky\" as a B-side. \"Magic\" was originally recorded for the \"Five Leaves Left\" sessions but did not appear on the final album. A version of the song with a different string arranger features on \"Time of No Reply\", Drake's 1986 outtakes compilation. For \"Made to Love Magic\" the song was artificially sped up and stripped of its original string section, which was scored by Richard Hewson. A separate string arrangement written in 1969 by Robert Kirby, recorded in 2004, was used as a backing to the new faster track. Upon its 2004 issue as a single, it was placed at #32 on the UK Singles Chart, the first time the single had appeared on the chart."}]}

After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist. Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", and the international top 10 singles \"Give Peace a ChanceInstant Karma!Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Lennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him.

He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer- director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films were more diverse in genre, among which included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. De Mille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film,\" The Squaw Man\"( 1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic,\" The Ten Commandments\"( 1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty- five years. De Mille directed\" The King of Kings\"( 1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. \" The Sign of the Cross\"( 1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \" Cleopatra\"( 1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with\" Samson and Delilah\"( 1949), a biblical epic which became the highest- grossing film of 1950.

Ron Hubbard by his first wife Margaret Louise Grubb, highly critical of his father and of the Church of Scientology. Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986) was an American author of science fiction and fantasy stories, and the founder of the Church of Scientology. In 1950, Hubbard authored  and established a series of organizations to promote Dianetics. In 1952, Hubbard lost the rights to Dianetics in bankruptcy proceedings, and he subsequently founded Scientology. Thereafter Hubbard oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in Helena, Montana. After his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam, Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at George Washington University to study civil engineering but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories and married Margaret \"Polly\" Grubb, who shared his interest in aviation. Hubbard was an officer in the Navy during World War II, where he briefly commanded two ships but was removed from command both times. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a variety of complaints. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as \"Commodore\" of the Sea Organization, an elite paramilitary group of Scientologists. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a totalitarian organization marked by intensive surveillance and a lack of freedom. Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert. In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of fraud after he was tried \"in absentia\" by France. In August 1978, 11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges for their role in the Church's Operation Snow White, one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history, with up to 5,000 covert agents. One of the indicted was Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard. L. Ron Hubbard was named an unindicted co-conspirator. Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life in a luxury motorhome on his California property, attended to by a small group of Scientology officials including his physician. In 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at age 74. Following Hubbard's death, Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to \"drop his body\" to continue his research on another planet. Though many of Hubbard's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious, The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms and rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is not historical fact."}]}

He taught at Chelsea College of Art before and after the war, before becoming head of illustration at the Royal College of Art. Sir George Ivan \"Van\" Morrison (born 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer- songwriter, instrumentalist and record producer. His professional career began as a teenager in the late 1950s playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Van Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967. After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record \"Astral Weeks\" (1968). Though this album gradually garnered high praise, it was initially a poor seller. Van Morrison has a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime. His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired; while many of his recordings, such as the studio albums \"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\", and the live album \" It's Too Late to Stop Now\", are acclaimed. \"Moondance\" (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances. He continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \" Brown Eyed GirlJackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album \"Astral Weeks\" and the lesser known \"Veedon Fleece\" and \"Common One\". The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic soul\". He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland. He is known by the nickname Van the Man to his fans."}]}

Lyalevo is known as the only village within the modern borders of Bulgaria that was inhabited by Greek Muslims( Vallahades). Lyalevo lay in the southeastern part of the Pirin mountains, in the southern part of the region of Pirin Macedonia. It was located at the foot of the Lalevski Vrah or Sveta Elena( Saint Helena) summit, from the town of Gotse Delchev( Nevrokop). Today, its ruins fall administratively within Bulgarian Blagoevgrad Province's Hadzhidimovo Municipality, close to the border with Greece and the Ilinden – Exochi border crossing. Lyalevo was mentioned as\" Lyaleva\" in Ottoman tax registers of 1623 – 1625 and 1635 – 1637 as a place populated by two Christian households. After 1821, though, the population mostly consisted of Greek- speaking Muslims. According to traditional stories recorded by Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov, those Greeks came from the Chalkidiki peninsula on the Aegean Sea in the first quarter of the 19th century. They fled their home places and converted to Islam following the massacres in the wake of an unsuccessful anti-Ottoman uprising in 1821, as part of the Greek War of Independence. In 1845, Russian slavist Viktor Grigorovich mentions the village as\" Lyaluhu\" and calls its residents\" Greek Pomaks\". Serbian scholar Stefan Verković notes that\" Lyalyuvo\" had 90 households or a population 300 Greek Muslims in 1889. Vasil Kanchov's study of 1900 records the population of\" Lalyovo\" as 620 Greek Muslims. After the Second Balkan War of 1913, Lyalevo's population moved to Greece because the village( as with all of Pirin Macedonia) became part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Some of the original inhabitants returned in 1916 only to abandon it forever in 1928, this time to settle in Turkey, while Bulgarian refugees from Greek Macedonia were settled in Lyalevo in 1926 – 1928. It ceased to exist in 1960 due to depopulation, as the inhabitants moved to other villages in the region, chiefly to Koprivlen. Hasanali Kandi( also Romanized as Ḩasan‘ al ī Kandī) is a village in Sardabeh Rural District, in the Central District of Ardabil County, Ardabil Province, Iran.

Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention. His innovative talents extended into his playing style, including licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques and timing, which set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day.

{"query": "Where was the composer of film Die Schöne Lurette born?", "topk": [{"text": "Jacques Offenbach( 20 June 1819 – 5 October 1880) was a German- French composer, cellist and impresario of the romantic period. He is remembered for his nearly 100 operettas of the 1850s – 1870s and his uncompleted opera\" The Tales of Hoffmann\". He was a powerful influence on later composers of the operetta genre, particularly Johann Strauss, Jr. and Arthur Sullivan. His best- known works were continually revived during the 20th century, and many of his operettas continue to be staged in the 21st. \" The Tales of Hoffmann\" remains part of the standard opera repertory. Born in Cologne, the son of a synagogue cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was accepted as a student at the Paris Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra- Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs- Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small- scale pieces, many of which became popular. In 1858, Offenbach produced his first full- length operetta,\" Orphée aux enfersOrpheus in the Underworld\"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained one of his most played works. During the 1860s, he produced at least 18 full- length operettas, as well as more one- act pieces. His works from this period included\" La belle Hélène\"( 1864),\" La Vie parisienne\"( 1866),\" La Grande- Duchesse de Gérolstein\"( 1867) and\" La Périchole\"( 1868). The risqué humour( often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London and elsewhere in Europe. Offenbach became associated with the Second French Empire of Napoleon III; the emperor and his court were genially satirised in many of Offenbach's operettas. Napoleon III personally granted him French citizenship and the Légion d' Honneur. With the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War in 1870, Offenbach found himself out of favour in Paris because of his imperial connections and his German birth. He remained successful in Vienna and London, however. He re-established himself in Paris during the 1870s, with revivals of some of his earlier favourites and a series of new works, and undertook a popular U.S. tour. In his last years he strove to finish\" The Tales of Hoffmann\", but died before the premiere of the opera, which has entered the standard repertory in versions completed or edited by other musicians. Die schöne Lurette is an East German film. It is an adaptation of the operetta\" Belle Lurette\" by Jacques Offenbach. It was released in 1960, and sold 3,267,070 tickets."}]}

He wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", is included on \"Mojo\" magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Jay Farrar, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Bob Childers, Sammy Walker, Tom Paxton, AJJ, Brian Fallon, and Sixto Rodríguez have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence. He frequently performed with the slogan \"This machine kills fascists\" displayed on his guitar. Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah, Oklahoma, until he was 14, when his mother Mary was hospitalized as a consequence of Huntington's disease, a fatal hereditary neurological disorder. His father moved to Pampa, Texas, to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends. He married at 19, but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD, achieving some fame from playing hillbilly music; made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck; and wrote a column for the communist newspaper \"People's World\" from May 1939 to January 1940. Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, although he did not appear to belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings. He left the station, ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\". In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song, \" This Land Is Your Land\". He said it was a response to what he felt was the overplaying of Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\" on the radio. Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son Arlo Guthrie became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of Huntington's disease. His first two daughters also died of the disease. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement, providing inspiration to a generation of new folk and country musicians, including mentoring Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan. \"Pastures of Plenty\" is a 1941 composition by Woody Guthrie. Describing the travails and dignity of migrant workers in North America, it is evocative of the world described in John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath. \" The tune is based on the ballad \"Pretty Polly\", a traditional English-language folk song from the British Isles that was also well known in the Appalachian region of North America."}]}

Known as \"The King of the Jukebox\", his highest profile came towards the end of the swing era. Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his time, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Jordan was also an actor and a film personality—he appeared in dozens of \"soundies\" (promotional film clips), made numerous cameos in mainstream features and short films, and starred in two musical feature films made especially for him. He was an instrumentalist who played all forms of the saxophone but specialized in the alto. He also played the piano and clarinet. A productive songwriter, he wrote or co-wrote many songs that were influential classics of 20th-century popular music. Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, but he became known as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of jump blues, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of the electronic organ. With his dynamic Tympany Five bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&B, urban blues and early rock-and-roll genres with a series of highly influential 78-rpm discs released by Decca Records. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including \"Rock Around the Clock\". Jordan ranks fifth in the list of the most successful African-American recording artists according to Joel Whitburn's analysis of \"Billboard\" magazine's R&B chart. Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, he had at least four million-selling hits during his career. Jordan regularly topped the R&B \"race\" charts and was one of the first black recording artists to achieve significant crossover in popularity with the mainstream (predominantly white) American audience, having simultaneous Top Ten hits on the pop charts on several occasions. \"Buzz Me\" is a 1946 double sided hit by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five. The single was the first song in 1946 to make the number one spot on the R&B chart and was the first of five Louis Jordan releases to make the top spot in 1946. \"Buzz Me\" also peaked at number nine on the pop chart. The B-side \"Don't Worry 'Bout That Mule\" would also hit number one on the R&B chart later in the year. \"Buzz Me\" was written by Fleecy Moore and Dave Dexter."}]}

The band is considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide. Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals) (and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band. Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's \"Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" programme, and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. \"Smoke on the Water\" is a song by the English rock band Deep Purple.

{"query": "Were both Oscar Bielaski and Ludwig Philippson, born in the same place?", "topk": [{"text": "Ludwig Philippson( 28 December 1811, at Dessau – 29 December 1889, at Bonn) was a German rabbi and author, the son of Moses Philippson, a printer, writer, teacher, translator, publisher and a member of Haskala, an intellectual movement dedicated to the modernisation of Jewish life and culture. Luwig published his first effort( published under his brother's name), a translation of the prophets Hosea, Joel, Obadiah, and Nahum, when he was fifteen years old. He was educated at the gymnasium of Halle where his older brother Phöebus was studying medicine. 1839 saw him continuing his education at the University of Berlin with a major in classical philology. As scholarships were not available to Jews and the family had exhausted their funds on educating Phöebus in medicine, Ludwig supported himself by tutoring and by doing literary work( some which became published). In 1830 he translated and annotated the works of two Judæo- Greek poets of Alexandria. A philological treatise on medical terms(\" Hyle Anthropine\", 1831, etc.) which revealed his qualities as a scholar, and his versatility was emphasized by the publication in 1832 of a vindication of Spinoza. After graduating the University of Berlin at the age of 22 in 1833, he was invited to be a preacher/ rabbi for the Magdeburg Jewish congregation. He was to remain in Magdeburg for the next 28 years. After being introduced to the Wolffstein family of five daughters in Magdeburg, he married the youngest, Julianne Wolffstein, in 1836. They were to have 3 daughters: Johanna, Bertha( 1839) and Rosalie( 1840). A son, Emil, was born in 1843 but died later in 1845. In 1837 he founded the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums( subtitled “ a non-partisan organ for all Jewish interests ”) in order to promote the interests of Judaism. It was the longest continuously published Jewish newspaper in Germany. Allgemeine is “ German Jewry ’s most important newspaper, ” and is one of the most frequently cited sources of nineteenth- century German Jewry. Allgemeine merged with the CV- Zeitung, the official publication of the Central Association of German Jews until the Nazis closed it down in November 1938 The content of Allgemeine would be Jewish enlightenment and reform, the place of Jews in society and their emancipation. However, after the 1871 unification of German states and the establishment of the second Reich, Allgemeine began to respond to the pernicious increase in anti-Semitism. Philippson would continue to edit that journal until his death in 1889. Two years later( 1839) he began an annotated German translation of the Hebrew Bible, which he completed in 1853. It was yet another German- Jewish translation of the Bible, one of perhaps 20 dating back to the Moses Mendelssohn translation of 1780. The differences in the version created by Philippson was in that each page had the original Hebrew text in one column with a German translation in another column, each page contained a textual explanation, not only with a commentary on the biblical material but also a cultural commentary. Most notably in one version were illustrations by Gustave Doré with his English wood engravings- something shocking in a Hebrew Bible that forbids such images of animals, temples, pagan ruins and gods and much more. In keeping with the philosophy of his father Moses Philippson, a committed member of the Jewish intellectual movement Haskala dedicated to overcoming Jewish ignorance and religious formalism, Luwig's intention was that the bible would help to extend the minds of the Jewish readers to a wider world of experiences, lands, history. Sigmund Freud ’s father, Jakob, knew the Hebrew Bible by heart and was a life long student of the Talmud. He eventually became influenced by the Jewish Enlightenment and subscribed to the publications of Ludwig and Phöebus Philippson. He substituted his classic Hebrew Bible with the illustrated and annotated version of the Hebrew/ German Ludwig Philippson ’s Bible. This was the Bible he used to teach his son. When Freud was 35, his father had the Bible rebound and presented it to his son with the hope that he would return to the faith. There has been some discussion about how the Philippson Bible and the illustrations influenced Freud's collection of antiquities and the development of his intellectual pursuits. In a 1935 addendum to his\" An Autobiographical Study\"( 1925[ 1924]), Freud gave issue to the effect of reading this Bible had on him:\" My deep engrossment in the Bible story( almost as soon as I had learnt the art of reading) had, as I recognized much later, an enduring effect upon the direction of my interest.\" ( p. 8). Julianne Philippson died in 1843 of lung tuberculosis. Ludwig married again in 1844 to Mathilde Hirsch, the sister of the wife of his brother Julius. They were to have six children: Joseph( 1840), Franz( 1851), Richard( 1853), Martin( 1856), Alfred( 1864). In 1847 he published\" Die Entwickelung der Religiösen Idee im Judenthum, Christenthum und Islam\", which was followed by\" Die Religion der Gesellschaft\", in 1848. Both of these works were translated into several languages. Ludwig was elected in 1848 for his region of Saxony to the Frankfurt National Assembly. The very next year he became a member of the Saxony trade council. On Feb. 12, 1855 Philippson published an article in Allgemeine proposing that a Jewish publication society be established. This led to the creation of the Institut zur Förderung der isralitischen Literatur in Leipzig in May of that year. It started with a subscriber membership of 1200 and increasing to over 2000 by the end of the year. This entitled the member to copies of works published that year that had been selected by a committee consisting of Ludwig Philippson, Adolph Jellinek of Leipzig, and Isaac Markus Jost of Frankfort- on- the- Main( for which the authors received an honoraria). That year the Austrian government prohibited anyone from become a member of the society and in 1858, while Philippson himself was on tour in Milan when he was expelled from Austrian territory. Through the efforts of Ludwig, the society was to last another 18 years( with a membership as high 3000) and to publish eighty works in German on topics such Jewish history, science, poetry, fiction and biographies- including works by Ludwig and his brother Phöebus. With poor health and failing eye- sight Ludwig was forced surrender his position as Rabbi in Magdeburg in 1862. He moved his family to Bonn where they first took up residence on the first floor of a gardener's house. The following year he purchased a residence on Grünen Weg, what now known as Königstrasse, where he would remain for twenty five year until his death. A further three generations would live in this house until it was taken by the Nazis. In Bonn he continued to write historical novels and dramatic, religious, and historical works, prayer books, essays and to comment of political issues like the social status of Jews and their emancipation. He would continue with his role of editor of the Allgemeine. He was involved in the local Jewish community, supporting the building of a new synagogue and the establishment of a new Jewish graveyard- he, his wife Mathilde and many of his children and grandchildren would eventually be buried in this graveyard. The geologist Alfred Philippson was his son. Oscar Bielaski( March 21, 1847 – November 8, 1911) was an American right fielder and the first Polish- American to play Major League Baseball, playing from 1872 until 1876. His father, Alexander Bielaski, a captain in the Union army, died at the Battle of Belmont. A. Bruce Bielaski, head of the Bureau of Investigation, and his sister, Ruth Shipley, head of the State Department's Passport Division, were first cousins of Oscar.

Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet( 21 October 1681 – 17 December 1751), born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, and died in London, served as Governor of Virginia from 1727 through 1749. Technically, Gooch only had the title Royal Lieutenant Governor, but the nominal governors, George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney, and Willem Anne van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle, were in England and did not exercise much authority. Gooch ’s tenure as governor was characterized by his unusual political effectiveness. One of his greatest successes was the passage of the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730. The Act called for the inspection and regulation of Virginia ’s tobacco, the most important crop of the colony. Tobacco planters were required to transport their crop to public warehouses where it was inspected and stored. The Act raised the quality of Virginia ’s tobacco and reduced fraud; this greatly increased the demand for Virginia tobacco in Europe. Gooch ’s military policy focused on protecting the western territory from Native Americans and French encroachment. He promoted the settlement of the Shenandoah Valley in order to buffer the rest of the colony from Indian attacks, and to prevent the French from settling the land. However, in the early 1730s, Western expansion was fraught by the Iroquois invasion each spring, as settlements inevitably fell along their war- trails leading south. Gooch decided to broker peace between the Six Nations and their southern enemies, to end the warfare. He hired Conrad Weiser to negotiate in the winter of 1736 and 1737, before the war season began. Weiser was successful in negotiating an armistice, allowing Gooch to authorize settlement of the Shenandoah Valley. He had many military credentials including fighting under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough in his campaigns in the Low Countries and as a colonel of Gooch's American Regiment with Admiral Edward Vernon in his expedition against Cartagena, New Grenada( now in Colombia) as part of the War of Jenkins' Ear. During King George's War, Gooch received an appointment as brigadier- general in charge of the army raised to invade Canada, but declined. Gooch was made a baronet in 1746 and a major general in 1747. Also in 1747, Gooch made a speech condemning all religious groups aside from the established Church. However, in 1738, Gooch had given a group of Presbyterians the right to settle new territory under the conditions of the English Act of Toleration. In 1749, Gooch left Virginia and returned to England. Gooch married Rebecca Staunton( for whom Staunton, Virginia is named), the daughter of a squire in Middlesex, England. The two had a son named William who grew up in Williamsburg. William became a naval officer, but died of the\" bloody flux\" at the age of 26, shortly before his parents returned to England. Gooch honored himself with the naming of Goochland County, Virginia in 1727. A residence hall at the College of William and Mary is also named in his honor."}]}

However, before she could marry, she died in early 1034. Her marriage was arranged to confirm a peace compact agreed between Henry and Conrad. She was buried in Worms Cathedral. Conrad’s chaplain Wipo of Burgundy mentioned Matilda as \"filia imperatoris Chuonradi et Giselæ, Mahthilda\". Conrad II (4 June 1039), also known as and , was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 until his death in 1039. The founder of the Salian dynasty of emperors who ruled for over a century, Conrad also served as King of Germany from 1024, King of Italy from 1026, and King of Burgundy (Arelat) from 1033. The son of a mid-level nobleman in Franconia, Count Henry of Speyer and Adelaide of Metz, he inherited the titles of count of Speyer and of Worms as an infant when his father died. Conrad extended his power beyond his inherited lands, receiving the favor of the princes of the Kingdom of Germany. When the Saxon-based Ottonian dynasty of emperors died off with the childless Emperor Henry II, Conrad was elected to succeed him as King in 1024 at the age of 34. Conrad continued the policies and achievements of the Ottonian Henry II regarding the Catholic Church and the affairs of Italy. Conrad continued to build the Church as a center for imperial power, preferring to appoint church bishops over secular lords to important posts across the Empire. Like Henry II before him, Conrad also continued a policy of benign neglect over Italy, especially for the city of Rome. His reign marked a high point of the medieval imperial rule and a relatively peaceful period for the Empire. Following the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Arles and conquered and incorporated it into the Empire. The three kingdoms (Germany, Italy, and Burgundy) formed the basis of the Empire as the \"royal triadregna tria\")."}]}

The Marshall Suite is a 1999 album by the Fall( their 20th). The album builds on the techno- influenced beats of its predecessor\" Levitate\"( 1997), while also returning to a more rockabilly- influenced sound reminiscent of earlier Fall line- ups. The end result has songs like the catchy\" Touch Sensitive\", and the strange, complex, thumping jungle beats of\" The Crying Marshall\". The album was long out of print, but a new 3- disc edition was released in the summer of 2011. \" The Marshall Suite\" was made immediately after an American tour during which Mark E. Smith had an onstage fight with members of the band and was arrested following ongoing altercations at the hotel where the group were staying. While the remaining band members quit and returned to England, leaving Smith in a cell in Manhattan, Nagle chose to stay in the band, helping to assemble a new line- up of the group. This new line- up was still taking shape during the recording of the album; the group shed a drummer before recording could even begin, and the album features two different bassists. For these reasons, it is something of a patchwork: out of 13 tracks,\" On My Own\" is a reworking of the previous album's\" Everybody But Myself\", three tracks are covers, two are sound collages, and\" The Crying Marshal\" is a remix by producer Steven Hitchcock of a Smith collaboration with the Filthy Three(\" Real Life of the Crying Marshal\"). Two songs use some of the same lyrics( a 14th track,\" Tom Raggazzi\"- a reggae- tinged reprise of\" Anecdotes ...\"- was included on the vinyl version). Nevertheless, the album was well received. Around the time of its release, rumours circulated that\" The Marshall Suite\" was a concept album about\" The Crying Marshall\". Smith stopped short of denying this, telling\" The Wire\" that\" I thought it would be good to do it as the story of his life, a themed LP, with a thread running through it. It's such an unhip thing to do\". An unpublished section of the interview, later placed on the magazine's website, suggested Smith was not yet finished with his creation:\" I do want to continue the Marshall theme, develop it. Maybe a five- sided thing next, the return of the Marshall\". However, he does not appear to have returned to the theme on any subsequent Fall album.

He secured the continued existence of the University of Freiburg in 1820, after which the University was called the Albert-Ludwig University.

The succession then went to the children of the morganatic second marriage of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich and Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, who was created Countess of Hochberg in the Austrian nobility at the personal request of Karl Friedrich.

Lee Jun-fan (November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee , was a Hong Kong-American actor, director, martial artist, martial arts instructor, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen, Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, California on November 27, 1940 to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle, and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the Hollywood, Hong Kong, and the rest of the world.

Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire, Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent. He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history. He was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent. During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects, with an annual revenue of $450 million (more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France), or £38,624,680 (2,879,469,894 rupees) in 1690. Under his reign, India surpassed Qing China to become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter of global GDP and more than the entirety of Western Europe, and its largest and wealthiest subdivision, the Bengal Subah, signaled the proto-industrialization. Aurangzeb was noted for his religious piety; he memorized the entire Quran, studied hadiths and stringently observed the rituals of Islam. Unlike his predecessors, including his father Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He did not enjoy a luxurious life and his personal expenses and constructions of small mosques were covered by his own earnings, which included the sewing of caps and trade of his written copies of the Quran. He also patronized works of Islamic and Arabic calligraphy. Aurangzeb has been subject to criticism. Critics argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his introduction of the \"jizya\" tax and other policies based on Islamic ethics, demolition of Hindu temples, the executions of his elder brother Dara Shikoh, Maratha king Sambhaji and the ninth Sikh guru Tegh Bahadur, and the prohibition and supervision of behaviour and activities that are forbidden in Islam such as music, gambling, fornication, and consumption of alcohol and narcotic. Various historians question the historicity of the claims of his critics, arguing that his destruction of temples has been exaggerated, and noting that he also built temples, paid for their maintenance, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, and opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims. Zeb-un-Nissa  (15 February 1638 – 26 May 1702) was a Mughal princess and the eldest child of Emperor Aurangzeb and his chief consort Dilras Banu Begum. She was also a poet, who wrote under the pseudonym of \"MakhfiHidden One\").

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with mental illness. He is often referred to as a genius and is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers Dennis and Carl, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s rock and roll and jazz-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1964, he suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as \"Pet Sounds\" (1966) and the unfinished \"Smile\". As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and substance abuse. Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy, Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, Brother Records Inc. Wilson was the first pop artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He is considered a major innovator in the field of music production, the principal originator of the California Sound, one of the first music producer auteurs, and the first rock producer to use the studio as its own instrument. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated with his early songs, and he was a major influence on the retrospectively-termed \"sunshine pop\" and Flower Power music that proceeded. In later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of punk rock and was regarded as \"godfather\" to an era of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, chamber pop orchestrations, and recording explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class and winning Grammy Awards for \"Brian Wilson Presents Smile\" (2004) and \"The Smile Sessions\" (2011). In lists published by \"Rolling Stone\", Wilson ranked 52 for the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" in 2008 and 12 for the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\" in 2015. In 2012, music publication \"NME\" ranked Wilson number 8 in its \"50 Greatest Producers Ever\" list, elaborating \"few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques were in the mid-60s\". His life was dramatized in the 2014 biopic \"Love & Mercy\". \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher for American rock band the Beach Boys about depression and social alienation. Also produced and sung by Wilson, it appears as the eleventh track on their 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\". He described it as \"about a guy who was crying out because he thought he was too advanced, and that he'd eventually have to leave people behind.\" Its chorus features Spanish-sung background vocals: Oh, ¿cuándo seré? Un día seré (\"When will I be? One day I will be\") The song is an early work of psychedelic rock. Its instrumentation includes harpsichord, muted bass guitar, and a theremin soundalike instrument called the Electro-Theremin. It is the first instance of an Electro-Theremin being used in popular music and the first in rock music to feature a theremin-like instrument."}]}

She is the sister of current Syrian President Bashar al- Assad. She is the widow of Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff of the Syrian Armed Forces and former head of the Syrian Military Intelligence, who was killed by the rebels on 18 July 2012. As a result of the Syrian Civil War, in March 2012 she was placed on a list of Syrian government figures who were subject to European Union economic sanctions and travel bans. On 28 September 2012, it was reported and confirmed by Gulf states that Bushra al- Assad had fled Syria with her five children to seek refuge in the United Arab Emirates. In January 2013, Bushra al- Assad was joined by her mother Anisa Makhlouf in Dubai after she too fled Syria, but she later returned. Anisa( or Aniseh) Makhlouf( 1930 or 1934 – 6 February 2016) was the Syrian matriarch of the Al- Assad family, which has ruled the country since 1971. The wife of the late President Hafez al- Assad, Makhlouf held the position of First Lady of Syria from 1971 until 2000. Her five children include Bashar al- Assad, the President of Syria since 2000. \" The Economist\" described Anisa Makhlouf as\" a formidable figure\" within the al- Assad family and the Ba'athist government. A highly influential member of the government, she was one of the few people with whom Bashar al- Assad regularly consulted during the Syrian Civil War. She is believed to have advocated for a heavy, military crackdown on Syrian protesters and rebels during the ongoing Civil War. Makhlouf was born around 1929 or 1930 in Latakia, Syria, to the Makhloufs, an influential family from Bustan al- Basha, Latakia Governorate. She married Hafez al- Assad, an officer of the Syrian Arab Air Force, in 1957. They had five children: Bushra( b. 1960), Bassel al- Assad( 1962–1994), Bashar al- Assad( b. 1965), Majd al- Assad( 1966 – 2009), and Maher al- Assad( b. 1967). Her marriage to Hafez al- Assad elevated the status and wealth of the Makhlouf family. Anisa Makhlouf's relatives were awarded lucrative contracts within the country's banking, oil and telecommunication sectors. One nephew, Rami Makhlouf, is believed to be the wealthiest man in Syria, with a net worth of US$ 5 billion, as of 2012. Following the death of Bassel al- Assad in 1994, Makhlouf favoured Maher al- Assad, her youngest son and a Syrian general, as a possible successor for her husband. Instead, Bashar al- Assad returned from London, joined the military, and succeeded his father as President of Syria in 2000. Makhlouf is believed to have advocated for a harsh crackdown on protesters and rebels during the Arab Spring and Syrian Civil War. In 2012, Makhlouf, as well as other members of the Al- Assad family, were sanctioned by the European Union amid the country's civil war and attacks on protesters by the Syrian government. The EU sanctions included a travel ban and the freezing of her assets. Prior to the travel ban, she had reportedly made frequent trips to Germany for medical treatments for an undisclosed illness."}]}

His second, \"Transformer\" (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought mainstream recognition.

Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with \"New Sensations\" (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album \"New York\". Reed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled \"Songs for Drella\" which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. \" Magic and Loss\" (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.

Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 – 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946). \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\" After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died."}]}

It stars Marlon Brando, Maria Schneider, and Jean-Pierre Léaud. The film's raw portrayal of sexual violence and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different venues. Upon release in the United States, the most graphic scene was cut and the MPAA gave the film an X rating. After revisions were made to the MPAA ratings code in 1997, the film was reclassified NC-17 for \"some explicit sexual content\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a censored R-rated cut in 1981.

From 1979 until his death in 2018, he was married to screenwriter Clare Peploe. Kim Ki-young ( October 10, 1919 – February 5, 1998) was a South Korean film director, known for his intensely psychosexual and melodramatic horror films, often focusing on the psychology of their female characters. Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cinémathèque screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council( KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki- young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang- soo, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon- ho and Park Chan- wook, claim Kim Ki- young as an influence on their careers."}]}

The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962. Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba's medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the \"Special Period\", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American \"pink tide\" – namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela – and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008. The longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized world opinion. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from American imperialism. Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus of a large number of Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced different individuals and groups across the world."}]}

Her marriage to Commodus did not produce an heir, and her husband was instead succeeded by Pertinax. Commodus (31 August 161 – 31 December 192), born Lucius Aurelius Commodus and died Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, was Roman emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father's death in 180, and solely until 192. His reign is commonly considered to mark the end of the golden period in the history of the Roman Empire known as the Pax Romana. During his father's reign, he accompanied Marcus Aurelius during the Marcomannic Wars in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. He was made the youngest consul in Roman history in 177 and later that year elevated to co-emperor with his father. His accession was the first time a son had succeeded his biological father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79. He was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather (who had adopted his father) as the two preceding emperors. Commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor \"born in the purple\", meaning during his father's reign. During his solo reign, the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but intrigues and conspiracies abounded, leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a god-like personality cult.

At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. He was known as a perfectionist who wrote, drawn and choreographed every scene to the most precise detail months before production began and never improvised anything. His reputation as a rigid, tyrannical director was somewhat contradicted by his friendly and kind behaviour towards the British and American child actors on the set of\" The Boys of Paul Street\". Fábri made nearly all of his films based on literary material( novels or short stories) and wrote the screenplays himself. His constant theme was the question of humanity. Many of his films are set in or around World War II. Two of his frequent collaborators were actress Mari Törőcsik and cinematographer György Illés. In 1969 he played the role of prosecuted statesman Zoltán Dániel in his friend Péter Bacsó's cult satire,\" A tan ú The Witness\") as his sole acting job. Fábri died in a heart attack at the age of 76 in 1994. His legal successor is Peter Fabri( b. 1985).

Justinian II was an ambitious and passionate ruler who was keen to restore the Roman Empire to its former glories, but he responded poorly to any opposition to his will and lacked the finesse of his father, Constantine IV. Consequently, he generated enormous opposition to his reign, resulting in his deposition in 695 in a popular uprising, and he only returned to the throne in 705 with the help of a Bulgar and Slav army. His second reign was even more despotic than the first, and it too saw his eventual overthrow in 711, abandoned by his army who turned on him before killing him.

{"query": "What is the award that the performer of song God'S Children (The Kinks Song) received?", "topk": [{"text": "The Kinks are an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965 (as a result of constant fighting between the brothers). Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \"You Really Got Me\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, American rock and roll, British music hall, folk, and country. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and are considered one of the most influential groups of the period. Early works included albums such as \"Face to Face\" (1966), \"Something Else\" (1967), \"The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society\" (1968), \"Arthur\" (1969), \"Lola Versus Powerman\" (1970), and \"Muswell Hillbillies\" (1971), along with their accompanying singles. After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums \"Sleepwalker\" (1977), \"Misfits\" (1978), \"Low Budget\" (1979), \"Give the People What They Want\" (1981) and \"State of Confusion\" (1983). In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. Ray Davies (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the band's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bass guitarist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 the band became an official five-piece when keyboardist John Gosling joined them, being replaced by Ian Gibbons in 1979, who remained in the band until they broke up in 1996 as a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US \"Billboard\" chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, The Kinks have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\". In 1990, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. In 2018, after years of ruling out a reunion, Ray Davies and Dave Davies announced they were working to reform the Kinks. God's Children is a song written by Ray Davies and performed by The Kinks. It was released as a single in 1971 and also on the soundtrack album of the film \"Percy\". The theme of \"God's Children\" is the limits of technology, inspired by the penis transplant subject matter of the \"Percy\" film. Music critic Johnny Rogan described the melody of \"God's Children\" as \"spellbinding.\" Ray Davies sings the lead vocal. The song uses acoustic instrumentation, accompanied by an orchestral arrangement by Stanley Myers. Dave Davies praised the song as \"phenomenal, an amazing song which is timeless and if you play it now it could sit quite comfortably in any decade. \" Kinks organist John Gosling regards \"God's Children\" as one of his three favorite Kinks' songs. Rogan has stated that Davies' \"plea for a return to Edenic innocence was powerful and moving and arguably the closest he has come to writing a religious song. Billboard Magazine\" described the song as \"a potent lyric ballad set to a rock beat\" and regarded it as a \"strong entry for Top 40, FM and Hot 100.\" However, the single's success was hampered by lack of promotion by the label, and lack of live concert support from the band. \"God's Children\" has been included on some Kinks compilation albums such as \"The Kink Kronikles\". A 25-second instrumental from the song entitled \"God's Children - End\" is used as the concluding track of \"Percy\"."}]}

It is preserved in the Library of Congress collection. Dudley Murphy( July 10, 1897 – February 22, 1968) was an American film director. Murphy was born on July 10, 1897 in Winchester, Massachusetts, to the artists Caroline Hutchinson( Bowles) Murphy( 1868- 1923) and Hermann Dudley Murphy( 1867- 1945, and whom his son was named for), both accomplished Modernist landscape painters. After first finding work as a journalist, Dudley Murphy began making films in the early 1920s. In his first short film,\" Soul of the Cypress\"( 1921), a variation on the Orpheus myth, the film's protagonist falls in love with a dryad( a wood nymph whose soul dwells in an ancient tree) and throws himself into the sea to become immortal and spend eternity with her. Murphy's then- wife Chase Harringdine played the dryad. Murphy followed this with\" Danse Macabre\"( 1922) featuring Adolph Bolm, Olin Howland, and Ruth Page. Both of these early films are in the DVD collection issued in October 2005( see link below). Murphy's eighth film,\" Ballet mécanique\", which he co-directed with the French artist Fernand Léger, premiered on 24 September 1924 at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik( International Exposition for New Theater Technique) in Vienna. Considered one of the masterpieces of early experimental filmmaking,\" Ballet mécanique\" also included creative input from Man Ray and Ezra Pound, and was presented at the exposition by Frederick Kiesler. The film was scheduled to be screened with George Antheil's masterpiece of the same name. However, the music ran close to 30 minutes, while the film was 17 minutes long. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a married print of the film. In her book\" Dudley Murphy: Hollywood Wild Card\", film historian Susan Delson argues persuasively that Murphy was the film's driving force but that Léger was more successful at promoting the film as his own creation. \" Ballet mécanique\", with the George Antheil music originally written for the film, was included in the DVD collection released in October 2005. In addition to\" Ballet mécanique\", Murphy is best remembered for\" St. Louis Blues\"( 1929) with Bessie Smith and Jimmy Mordecai,\" Black and Tan\"( 1929) with Duke Ellington and His Orchestra,\" Confessions of a Co- Ed\"( 1931),\" The Sport Parade\"( 1932) with Joel McCrea, and\" The Emperor Jones\"( 1933), starring Paul Robeson. In 1932, Murphy helped introduce the Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros to prominent people in the Los Angeles community. To show his gratitude, Siqueiros painted a mural on a wall in Murphy's Pacific Palisades home. The only intact mural by Siqueiros in the United States,\" Portrait of Mexico Today\" was donated anonymously to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in 1999. From the late 1940s through the 1960s Murphy and his fourth wife, Virginia, owned and operated Holiday House, an exclusive Malibu hotel designed by Richard Neutra and favored by the Hollywood elite. Black and Tan( 1929) is a musical short film written and directed by Dudley Murphy about a couple in the performing arts; it is set during the contemporary Harlem Renaissance in New York City.

Hepburn plays the widow of a famous civic leader who has suddenly died in an accident, while Tracy portrays a former war correspondent who intends to write a flattering biography of the dead man, only to find that his death is shrouded in mystery. Screenwriter Stewart considered the script to be the finest moment of his entire career, feeling vindicated by the assignment as he believed that Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views. Principal filming began in the last week of August 1942, four months after the release of the novel, published by Random House. The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage, with no location shooting. Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Tracy, and due to his heavy drinking, she became his constant guardian during filming. The film was screened for the Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures on December 2, 1942, where it was disapproved of by the Bureau's chief, Lowell Mellett. \" Keeper of the Flame\" premiered to a poor reception at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday, March 18, 1943.

She acted as regent of the County of Bar from 1344 until 1353. She was a daughter of Henry III, Count of Bar and Eleanor of England, and niece of Edward II of England. She was unhappily married to John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey. In 1345, Joan became the regent of Bar for her great- nephew Robert. Eleanor of England (18 June 1269 – 29 August 1298) was an English princess, the eldest surviving daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile. What evidence exists for Eleanor's early years suggests that while her parents were absent on Crusade between 1270 and 1274, she became very close to her paternal grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, with whom she continued to spend a good deal of time. She was also close to her sickly brother Henry. On one Pentecost Eve, Henry and Eleanor were given two partridges for their dinner, for a special treat. For a long period Eleanor was betrothed to King Alfonso III of Aragon. Alfonso's parents were under papal interdict, however, because of their claims to the throne of Sicily, which were contrary to the papal donation of the Sicilian throne to Charles I of Naples, and despite the Aragonese ruler's repeated pleas that Edward I send his daughter to them for marriage, Edward refused to send her as long as the interdict remained in place. In 1282 he declined one such request by saying that his wife and mother felt the girl, who had just turned 13, was too young to be married, and that they wanted to wait another two years before sending her to Aragon. Alfonso died before the marriage could take place. Eleanor subsequently married the French nobleman, Henry III, Count of Bar on September 20, 1293, and had two children: According to Kenneth Panton, Eleanor is credited with a daughter called Eleanor (b.1285), who supposedly married a Welshman named Llywelyn ap Owain.

Magee was born in Paris, France, where his father, a Texas oil man, was working at the time. He grew up in Dallas, Texas. Magee attended the University of Oklahoma from 1981–1984. While there he was a distinguished member of the golf team, winning All-American honors three times. He turned pro in 1984 and joined the PGA Tour in 1985. Magee won four PGA Tour events.

His most recent win was at the 1994 Northern Telecom Open. His best finish in a major was T5 at the 1992 British Open. He has featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Magee is the only person in PGA Tour history to hit a hole-in-one on a par 4 hole during a PGA Tour event. He did this with a driver at the 332-yard 17th hole of the 2001 Phoenix Open. The ball caromed off Tom Byrum's putter on its way to the bottom of the cup. Byrum, in the group ahead, was squatting down looking over a putt.

Louis Racine( born 6 November 1692, Paris; died 29 January 1763, Paris) was a French poet of the Age of the Enlightenment. The second son and the seventh and last child of the celebrated tragic dramatist Jean Racine, he was interested in poetry from childhood but was dissuaded from trying to make it his career by the poet Boileau on the grounds that the gift never existed in two successive generations. However, in 1719 Racine became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions and published his first major poem,\" La Grâce\", in 1722. But, because of the poem's Jansenist inspiration, Cardinal de Fleury, chief minister of Louis XV, blocked the poet's admission to the Académie Française, and instead Racine was induced to accept the post of inspector- general of taxes at Marseille in Provence. For the next 24 years, although he continued to write poetry, Racine worked as a tax inspector in various provincial towns and cities, marrying in 1728. His most important poem,\" La Religion\", in which he was careful to avoid further accusations of Jansenism, was published in 1742. He eventually retired from government service in 1746, aged 54, and returned to Paris where he devoted himself to his writing. In November 1755, he lost his only son and his daughter- in- law when they were swept away by the tsunami from the Lisbon earthquake while on honeymoon at Cadiz in Spain. This tragedy, commemorated by the French poet Écouchard- Lebrun, is said to have broken Racine's spirit. He sold his large library, gave up writing, and devoted himself now to the practice of religion. It was around this time that Racine wrote his last published work, an essay on the famous feral child of 18th- century France Marie- Angélique Memmie Le Blanc whom he had interviewed and written of in his philosophical poem\" L'Épître II sur l'homme\"( 1747)(\" Second Epistle on Man\"). Louis Racine was characterised by Voltaire, the leading French intellectual of his day, as\" le bon versificateur Racine, fils du grand Racinethe good versifier Racine, son of the great Racine\"). His\" Oeuvres complètes\"( complete works) were collected in six volumes and published in Paris in 1808.

Tuđman was born in Belgrade (then PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia) where he completed grade school, before he moved with his family to Zagreb in 1961. He was born on his parents 1st anniversary. He was named \"Miroslav\" for Miroslav Krleža who was adored by his father at that period. He graduated from gymnasium and then from the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Zagreb in 1970. He became part of the faculty, and received a doctorate in information sciences at the same University in 1985. In 1989 he founded the Institute for Information Studies at the Faculty. He participated in the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, and in 1992 he became the head of the Center for Strategic Research. Later he was the deputy head of the National Security Office and then the founder and leader of the first Croatian intelligence agency (HIS) between 1993 and 1998, and then from 1999 to 2000. In 1995, President Tuđman decorated him with the Order of Duke Domagoj, for war-time merit as a member of the political administration of the Ministry of Defence. In 1998 he became a tenured professor at the Faculty of Philosophy. His first political activity was as a co-founder of the Social Democrats of Croatia together with his friend Antun Vujić, but he soon switched to his father's party the Croatian Democratic Union. He briefly retired from politics until 2001, when he ran for the Zagreb City Council and his list won 7.6% of the vote. The same year he and Nenad Ivanković founded the party Croatian True Revival , which later cooperated with Croatian Bloc of Ivić Pašalić, but gained no traction at the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election. In 2009 he was a candidate in the Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010, where he won 4.09% of the vote in the first round and was eliminated. In 2011, he became a candidate in the 2011 Croatian parliamentary election on the electoral list of the Croatian Democratic Union. Franjo Tuđman, also written as Franjo Tudjman (14 May 1922 – 10 December 1999), was a Croatian politician and historian. Following the country's independence from Yugoslavia he became the first President of Croatia and served as president from 1990 until his death in 1999. He was the 9th and last President of the Presidency of SR Croatia from May to July 1990. Tuđman was born in Veliko Trgovišće, Croatia. In his youth he fought during World War II as a member of the 10th Zagreb Corps of the Croatian Partisans. After the war he took a post in the Ministry of Defence, later attaining the rank of major general of the Yugoslav Army in 1960. After his military career he dedicated himself to the study of geopolitics. In 1963 he became a professor on the Zagreb Faculty of Political Sciences. He received a doctorate in history in 1965 and worked as a historian until coming into conflict with the regime. Tuđman participated in the Croatian Spring movement that called for reforms in the country and was imprisoned for his activities in 1972. He lived relatively anonymously in the following years until the end of Communism, whereupon he began his political career by founding the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in 1989. HDZ won the first Croatian parliamentary elections in 1990 and Tuđman became the President of the Presidency of SR Croatia. As president, Tuđman introduced a new constitution and pressed for the creation of an independent Croatia. On 19 May 1991, an independence referendum was held, which was approved by 93 percent of voters. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Areas with a Serb majority revolted, backed by the Yugoslav army, and Tuđman led Croatia during its War of Independence. A ceasefire was signed in 1992, but the war had spread into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Croats fought in an alliance with Bosniaks. Their cooperation fell apart in late 1992 and Tuđman's government sided with Herzeg-Bosnia during the Croat-Bosniak War with the goal to reunite the Croatian people, a move that brought criticism from the international community. In March 1994, he signed the Washington Agreement with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović that re-allied Croats and Bosniaks. In August 1995, he authorized a major offensive known as Operation Storm which effectively ended the war in Croatia. In the same year, he was one of the signatories of the Dayton Agreement that put an end to the Bosnian War. He was re-elected president in 1992 and 1997 and remained in power until his death in 1999. While supporters point out his role in achieving Croatian independence, critics have described his presidency as authoritarian. Surveys after Tuđman's death have generally shown a high favorability rating among the Croatian public."}]}

He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour, and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films, while mild by modern standards, were unprecedented in his day. His first major gothic horror film was\" The Curse of Frankenstein\"( 1957), which launched Hammer's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects, including\" Dracula\"( 1958),\" The Mummy\"( 1959), and\" The Curse of the Werewolf\"( 1961). Given their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher's films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an\" auteur\" in his own right. His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality, morality, and ‘ the charm of evil ’. Drawing heavily on a Christian conservative outlook, there is often a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason, in contrast to other characters, who are either blindly superstitious or bound by cold, godless rationalism.

David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie , was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album \" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \" The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\" (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\"Heroes (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos.

The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold \"Gold\", which included the hit single, \"New York, New York\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, \"Demolition\" (2002).

As a compromise, \"Love Is Hell\" was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004. After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Adams took a short-lived break, and formed The Cardinals, a backing band that accompanied him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, after the release of \"Cardinology\" (2009), Adams disbanded The Cardinals and announced an extended break from music due to complications from Ménière's disease.

{"query": "Where did Anne Margaret Coke, Viscountess Anson's father graduate from?", "topk": [{"text": "Thomas William Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (6 May 1754 – 30 June 1842), known as Coke of Norfolk or Coke of Holkham, was a British politician and agricultural reformer. Born to Wenman Coke, Member of Parliament (MP) for Derby, and his wife Elizabeth, Coke was educated at several schools, including Eton College, before undertaking a Grand Tour of Europe. After returning to Britain and being married, Coke's father died, leaving him the owner of a 30,000 acre Norfolk estate. Returned to Parliament in 1776 for Norfolk, Coke became a close friend of Charles James Fox, and joined his Eton schoolmate William Windham in his support of the American colonists during the American Revolutionary War. As a supporter of Fox, Coke was one of the MPs who lost their seats in the 1784 general election, and he returned to Norfolk to work on farming, hunting, and the maintenance and expansion of Holkham Hall, his ancestral home. Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1790, sitting continuously until 1832, and he primarily spoke on matters of local interest, such as the Corn Laws. His second focus was on civil liberties, and he spoke out against the government's response to the Peterloo Massacre and similar events. Described as the \"greatest commoner in England\", he chose the passage of the Great Reform Act 1832 as the moment to retire, later being made the Earl of Leicester in July 1837. After a short illness, Coke died on 30 June 1842, and was succeeded as Earl by his son Thomas. Coke's main legacy is as an agricultural reformer, not as a politician; he has historically been credited with sparking the British Agricultural Revolution through the reforms he made to farming on his estates. Later historians have questioned this, however, noting that the developments credited to him are most likely the work of other individuals; nevertheless, he has still been described as \"the real hero of Norfolk agriculture\".

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame."}]}

Charles Edward Anderson Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer and songwriter, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. Nicknamed the \"Father of Rock and Roll\", Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \" Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded \"Maybellene\"—Berry's adaptation of the country song \"Ida Red\"—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart.

But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. However, in 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of \"My Ding-a-Ling\" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion. Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having \"laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance. \" Berry is included in several of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"greatest of all time\" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The novel has been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations. Nair's version made notable changes in the development of main character Becky Sharp, played by Reese Witherspoon. The film received several awards and nominations, including being nominated for the Golden Lion at the 2004 Venice Film Festival. Distant Vision is an ongoing experimental film project by Francis Ford Coppola. Different versions of this production have been broadcast to limited audiences from the stages of Oklahoma City Community College on June 5, 2015, and at UCLA School of Theater in July 2016. Coppola led the project as a proof of concept piece for a richer, more in- depth future live broadcast that will recount the struggles and triumphs of three generations of an Italian- American family set against the birth and growth of the invention of television. Mira Nair( born 15 October 1957) is an Indian- American filmmaker based in New York City. Her production company, Mirabai Films, specializes in films for international audiences on Indian society, whether in the economic, social or cultural spheres. Among her best known films are\" Mississippi Masala The Namesake\", the Golden Lion winning\" Monsoon Wedding\", and\" Salaam Bombay!\", which received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Francis Ford Coppola (born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, film composer, and vintner. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. After directing \"The Rain People\" in 1969, Coppola co-wrote \"Patton\" (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of \"The Godfather\" (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, and was adored by the public and critics alike. \" The Godfather\" won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo). \"The Godfather Part II\", which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. \" The Conversation\", which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice. While a number of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and 1990s were critically lauded, he has never quite achieved the same commercial success with films as in the 1970s. His best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish\" (both 1983), the crime dramas \"The Cotton Club\" (1984) and \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990), and the horror film \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992).

Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a \"maverick\" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a \"subversive\" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being \"anti-Hollywood\" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could \"make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\" In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award.

The film is considered by some critics as a notable twist in the artistic career of Kiarostami. The film features close- ups of many notable Iranian actresses and French actress Juliette Binoche as they watch a film based on a part mythological Persian romance tale of Khosrow and Shirin, with themes of female self- sacrifice. The film has been described as\" a compelling exploration of the relationship between image, sound and female spectatorship.\" The film depicts the audience's emotional involvement with the story. The story is read between the tragic and kitsch by a cast of narrators led by Manoucher Esmaieli and is accompanied by a historical\" film score\" by Morteza Hananeh and Hossein Dehlavi. The film's production is replete with curious anecdotes. According to some reports, the women were filmed individually in Kiarostami's living room, with the director asking them to cast their gaze at a mere series of dots above the camera. The director has also stated that, during the filming process, he had no idea what film they were watching, and settled on the Khosrow and Shirin myth only after shooting had concluded. In\" Taste of Shirin\"( 2008, 27 minutes), a documentary by Hamideh Razavi on the making of the film, one can see how the film really was shot. The brief appearance of Juliette Binoche in the film came as the result of her role in another Kiarostami project. It was first screened at the 65th Venice International Film Festival.

In 1925 he went to the United States to make \"The Lost Chord\", a remake of one of his earlier British hits. He stayed to make several more films in America during the late 1920s before returning to Britain. He was born in South Kensington, London and died in Worthing, Sussex. Abbas Kiarostami( 22 June 1940 – 4 July 2016) was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, poet, photographer, and film producer. An active film- maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the\" Koker\" trilogy( 1987– 1994),\" Close- Up\"( 1990),\" The Wind Will Carry Us\"( 1999), and\" Taste of Cherry\"( 1997), which was awarded the Palme d' Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works,\" Certified Copy\"( 2010) and\" Like Someone in Love\"( 2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films\" Where Is the Friend ’s Home? Close- Up\", and\" The Wind Will Carry Us\" were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. \" Close- Up\" was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial\" Sight& Sound\" poll conducted in 2012. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid- Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary- style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.

He was also called Abu Muhammad and Ibn al-Ridha. Because Samarra, the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as al-Askari (\"Askar\" is the word for \"military\" in Arabic). Al-Askari married Narjis Khatun (also recorded as Sawsan, Mariam) and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life. According to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tamid and was buried in Samarra. It was known that many Shia were looking forward to the succession of his son, Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi, as they believed him to be the twelfth Imam, who was destined to remove injustice from the world. Hujjat Allah ibn al-Hasan al-Mahdi , also known as Imam al-Mahdi  and Imām al-Zaman (meaning \"Imam of Our Time\"), Hujjat ibn Hasan and Muhammad ibn Hasan ibn Ali or Muhammad ibn Hasan, is believed by Shia Twelver Muslims to be the Mahdi, an eschatological redeemer of Islam and ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imam of the Twelve Imams who will emerge with Isa (Jesus Christ) in order to fulfill their mission of bringing peace and justice to the world. Twelver Shias believe that al-Mahdi was born on the 15th Sha'ban 879 CE/ 255AH and assumed Imamate at nearly 5 years of age following the killing of his father Hasan al-Askari. In the early years of his Imamate, he is believed to have had contact with his followers only through The Four Deputies. After a 69-year period, known as the Minor Occultation , a few days before the death of his fourth deputy Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri in 948, he is believed to have sent his followers a letter. In that letter which was transmitted by al-Samarri he declared the beginning of Major Occultation , during which Mahdi is not in contact with his followers directly but has instructed them to follow the pious high clerics for whom he has mentioned some distinguishing merits. Sunni Muslims reject that he is the Mahdi and believe that the Mahdi has not yet been born. They believe his exact identity is only known to Allah, other than the idea that he is to be from the descendants of Muhammad. Aside from the Mahdi's precise genealogy, Sunnis accept many of the same hadiths which Shias accept about the predictions regarding the Mahdi's emergence, his acts, and his universal Caliphate. Sunnis also have many hadiths about Mahdi which are in their Hadith collections."}]}

{"query": "Which magazine was established first, Sybil'S Garage or Kaurab?", "topk": [{"text": "Sybil's Garage was a speculative fiction, poetry, and art journal, published by Senses Five Press. Issues one through six were released as a small press magazine, or zine. Issue seven was released in trade paperback format. The publication combines artwork with fiction and poetry for a unique aesthetic. The majority of the stories have tended toward slipstream fiction (see interstitial art), but some stories fall into traditional genres such as science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction. Above each story is the author's suggested musical accompaniment, thus adding to the magazine's intended effect of engaging multiple senses. Sybil's Garage was founded in 2003 by Matthew Kressel and Devin Poore of Hoboken, New Jersey as an experiment in creating their own zine. In May 2007 issues one through four were entered into the permanent collection of the Hoboken Historical Museum. Issue No. 7 was pre-released at Readercon, the conference on imaginative literature, on July 9, 2010. The issue was released officially on July 21, 2010. Kaurab is a Bengali language literary magazine representing innovative, alternative, non-mainstream and experimental genres of Indian literature with an emphasis on poetry and poetics. In vogue for more than three decades, Kaurab continuously streams alternative genres of literature and has published scores of innovative Bengali writers. While some of them are deemed legendary and have been evaluated as literary myths, what keeps the wheel churning at Kaurab today is a whole new generation of creative writing. The Kaurab literary movement never owned an official manifesto. However, like any other literary upsurge, the emergence of the core group was largely necessitated by social and literary developments in India a quarter century after independence from British colonial rule. The core Kaurab poets and writers represent an interesting break with earlier traditions. Mainstream Bangla literature, back then, was in the thrall of the social, political and cultural upheavals precipitated by the Naxalite movement. While Kaurab, as a literary group, had a camaraderie with the Hungry Generation and other writers of Bengal, it largely attempted to accentuate a fresh and marginal voice that was unheard in Bangla literature. In contrast to the previous literary movements and coteries of the 1960s, Kaurab writers demonstrated greater variety and individuality, a complete nonchalance to existing literary stereotypes, political aloofness, a deep desire to reconnect with the sub-altern, language experiments involving the inner diaspora and a certain high-dreaming flamboyance which little magazines normally undervalue. A lot of these values can be directly attributed to Kaurab's founder editor Kamal Chakrabarty and fellow poets - Deba Prasad Banerjee, Swadesh Sen, Sidhartha Basu, Barin Ghosal, Debajyoti Dutta, Shankar Lahiri, Aryanil Mukhopadhyay & others. The \"Kaurab MagazineKaurab Patrikaa\") has been in print since 1970. In 1982 it won the D. K. Gupta award as the most distinguished Bengali literary magazine. Kaurab's online version, \"Kaurab Online\", is an electronic webzine of poetry and poetics, and houses an international translation and poetry book review archive. The webzine began in 1998, initially as a member site, moving on to becoming an independent dot com site in 2003. The publication of Kaurab's 100th print issue was celebrated in the Indian Museum on 5 December 2004 with a poetry festival. Since then the magazine has been edited by its online editor Aryanil Mukhopadhyay supported by Kaurab's second generation writers Sabyasachi Sanyal, Sudeshna Majumdar and Subhro Bandopadhyay. In 2007, the new editorial team and its group of poets/writers around the world took the magazine to an unprecedented height by launching an International Poetry Reading/Discussion Series conducted over three continents in three languages - Bengali, English and Spanish. Poets from India, England, Spain, Chile and the US have participated in these events. The print magazine is currently bi-annual, while the webzine version is tri-annual."}]}

{"query": "Do both films The Great Moment (1944 Film) and Crime Over London have the directors from the same country?", "topk": [{"text": "Crime Over London is a 1936 British crime film directed by Alfred Zeisler and starring Margot Grahame, Paul Cavanagh and David Burns. It was made at Isleworth Studios, based on the novel\" House of a Thousand Windows\" by Ludwig von Wohl. The film's sets were designed by art director Edward Carrick. The Great Moment is a 1944 biographical film written and directed by Preston Sturges. Based on the book\" Triumph Over Pain\"( 1940) by René Fülöp- Miller, it tells the story of Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, a 19th- century Boston dentist who discovered the use of ether for general anesthesia. The film stars Joel McCrea and Betty Field, and features Harry Carey, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Porter Hall. The movie was filmed in 1942 but not released for over two years, and the released version differed from what Preston Sturges had wished, although he publicly accepted the film as his own. Paramount Pictures disliked the film Sturges had made, and pulled it from his control, re-titled and re-edited it, in the process making it( especially in the early segment) more confusing for the audience to understand. The studio's released version was marketed in a way that made it appear to be one of Sturges' comedies. The film was not well received by the critics or the public, and marked the end of a sustained run of success for Sturges, who had already left Paramount by the time the film was released. Although rarely seen today, the film is worth viewing for its flashback structure – comparable in some ways to\" Citizen Kane\", which was influenced by the earlier film\" The Power and the Glory\", for which Sturges wrote the screenplay – and for its irreverent and subtly satirical tone, unusual for a time when most Hollywood biopics were over- inflated and sentimental. In 2003 a medical- dental historian in a lengthy analysis of the movie and its history -- which cited its flashback structure, timeless subject, injections of humor, and\" un- Pasteur- like\" treatment of its protagonist, while adhering reasonably well to the historical record -- concluded that\" The Great Moment may now be due for a general reevaluation by movie historians and critics who, like most folks, have never felt much affection for dentists past and present.\" Preston Sturges( born Edmund Preston Biden; August 29, 1898 – August 6, 1959) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and film director. In 1941, he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film\" The Great McGinty\", his first of three nominations in the category. Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It is not uncommon for a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. Prior to Sturges, other figures in Hollywood( such as Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts, however Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were separate. Sturges famously sold the story for\" The Great McGinty\" to Paramount Pictures for$ 1, in return for being allowed to direct the film. Alfred Zeisler( September 26, 1892 – March 1, 1985) was an American- born German film producer, director, actor and screenwriter. He produced 29 films between 1927 and 1936.

Thomas Alan Waits (born December 7, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, composer, and actor. His music is characterized by lyrics focusing on the underside of society, delivered in his distinctive deep, gravelly voice. During the 1970s, he worked primarily in jazz, but since the 1980s his music has reflected greater influence from blues, vaudeville, and experimental genres. Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family in Pomona, California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a teenager, relocating to Los Angeles in 1972. He worked there as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented \"Closing Time\" (1973) and \"The Heart of Saturday Night\" (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with \"Small Change\" (1976), \"Blue Valentine\" (1978), and \"Heartattack and Vine\" (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's 1981 film \"One from the Heart\", and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films. In 1980, Waits married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. Under his wife's encouragement, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including \"Swordfishtrombones\" (1983), \"Rain Dogs\" (1985), and \"Franks Wild Years\" (1987). He continued appearing in films, taking a leading role in Jim Jarmusch's \"Down by Law\" (1986), and made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson he produced two musicals, \"The Black Rider\" and \"Alice\", first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, Waits' albums \"Bone Machine\" (1992), \"The Black Rider\" (1993), and \"Mule Variations\" (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and various Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label Anti-, which released \"Blood Money\" (2002), \"Alice\" (2002), \"Real Gone\" (2004), and \"Bad as Me\" (2011). Although attracting little commercial success domestically, Waits attracted an international cult following and has been widely covered by other singers.

Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame."}]}

Leopold's reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the east and rivalry with Louis XIV, a contemporary and first cousin, in the west. After more than a decade of warfare, Leopold emerged victorious from the Great Turkish War thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the Treaty of Karlowitz, Leopold recovered almost all of the Kingdom of Hungary, which had fallen under Turkish power in the years after the 1526 Battle of Mohács. Leopold fought three wars against France: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold sought to give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance, disregarding the will of the late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on until 1714, nine years after Leopold's death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations.

The Golden Gate Quartet recorded the song on March 16, 1945. This version was released on Okeh Records #6741. Elvis Presley also recorded this song. It was released on the album \" Elvis Is Back!\". It was the first song that Elvis' army buddy, Charlie Hodge, sang harmony with Elvis. Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame."}]}

Seven films directed by King were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Lightnin' is a 1930 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Henry King and written by S. N. Behrman and Sonya Levien. The film stars Will Rogers, Louise Dresser, Joel McCrea, Helen Cohan, Jason Robards, Sr. and Luke Cosgrave. The film was released on December 7, 1930, by Fox Film Corporation. It is a remake of the 1925 silent film, which was directed by John Ford. Jacques Tati( born Jacques Tatischeff,; 9 October 1907 – 5 November 1982) was a French mime, filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. Throughout his long career, he worked as a comic actor, writer, and director. In a poll conducted by\" Entertainment Weekly\" of the Greatest Movie Directors, Tati was voted the 46th greatest of all time. With only six feature- length films to his credit as director, he directed fewer films than any other director on this list of 50. Tati's\" Playtime\"( 1967) ranked 43rd in the 2012\" Sight& Sound\" critics' poll of the greatest films ever made. As David Bellos puts it,\" Tati, from\" l' Ecole des facteurs\" to\" Playtime\", is the epitome of what an\" auteur\" is( in film theory) supposed to be: the controlling mind behind a vision of the world on film\". Playtime( sometimes written PlayTime) is a 1967 French- Italian comedy film directed by Jacques Tati. In\" Playtime\", Tati again plays Monsieur Hulot, a character who had appeared in his earlier films\" Mon Oncle\" and\" Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot\". As mentioned on the production documentary that accompanies the Criterion Collections DVD of the film, by 1964 Tati had grown ambivalent towards playing Hulot as a recurring central role. Unable to dispense with the popular character altogether, Hulot appears intermittently in\" Playtime\", alternating between central and supporting roles. \" Playtime\" was made from 1964 through 1967. Shot in 70 mm, the work is notable for its enormous set, which Tati had built specially for the film, as well as Tati's trademark use of subtle, yet complex visual comedy supported by creative sound effects; dialogue is frequently reduced to the level of background noise. \" Playtime\" is considered Tati's masterpiece, as well as his most daring work. In 2012, Playtime was 43rd in the British Film Institute's critics' list and 37th in their directors' list of\" Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\"."}]}

The film is frequently shown with narration by announcer Herbert Morrison who was present to watch the zeppelin's arrival. Morrison's commentary was recorded but not broadcast until later. It has since been combined with the separately filmed newsreel footage. Most of the original newsreels have their own narration, and many composite edits have been made for documentaries. One common composite found on the internet is a silent film with Pathé News footage of the first 1936 landing at Lakehurst and Hearst News of the Day Newsreel footage of the disaster, called a\" Pathegram\" by Eugene Castle of Castle Films. Another edit popularized on video- sharing sites like YouTube uses footage of the Disaster from Paramount and Movietone Newsreel with Herb Morrison's recording. The Pathé News and Universal Newsreels are freely available from government archives. Since 1995, The Pathé News archive has been named British Pathé. Four newsreel teams were in attendance at the time of the disaster. They were positioned close to each other and adjacent to the mooring mast for the airship. As a result, the newsreels do not show the mooring mast for the airship to be moored( other mooring masts appear in the background in many of the reels), unlike many of the press photographs which were taken further away which show the mast as well as two of the newsreel cameramen with their cameras mounted atop of newsreel trucks. None of the newsreels captured the initial signs of disaster as the cameras had momentarily stopped filming after the ground crew caught the landing ropes( the fire started approximately four minutes after the first starboard rope was dropped at 7:21). At least one film taken by a spectator is known to exist, showing a side view of the stern on fire and the tail crashing to the ground.

{"query": "Which film has the director died earlier, A Bay Of Blood or Love, Cherish, Respect?", "topk": [{"text": "Mario Bava( 31 July 1914 – 27 April 1980) was an Italian cinematographer, director, special effects artist and screenwriter, frequently referred to as the\" Master of Italian Horror\" and the\" Master of the Macabre\". His low- budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as\" Hercules\"( 1958) and its sequel\" Hercules Unchained\"( 1959)( each were lampooned on\" Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including\" I Vampiri\"( 1957)( the first Italian horror film of the sound era),\" The Day the Sky Exploded\"( 1958)( the first Italian science fiction film),\" Caltiki – The Immortal Monster\"( 1959) and\" The Giant of Marathon\"( 1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres:\" Black Sunday\"( 1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle;\" The Girl Who Knew Too Much\"( 1963) is considered to be the first giallo film;\" Kill, Baby, Kill\"( 1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror;\" Roy Colt& Winchester Jack\"( 1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self- parodying Spaghetti Westerns;\" Four Times That Night\"( 1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and\" A Bay of Blood\"( 1971) was a precursor to slasher films. His other notable films include\" Hercules in the Haunted World\"( 1961),\" Erik the Conqueror\"( 1961),\" Black Sabbath\"( 1963),\" The Whip and the Body\"( 1963),\" Blood and Black Lace\"( 1964),\" Planet of the Vampires\"( 1965),\" Knives of the Avenger\"( 1966),( 1968),\" Hatchet for the Honeymoon\"( 1970),\" Five Dolls for an August Moon\"( 1970),\" Baron Blood\"( 1972),\" Lisa and the Devil\"( 1974),\" Rabid Dogs\"( 1974) and\" Shock\"( 1977). Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self- deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood. Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino. His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right. Michał Waszyński( 29 September 1904 – 20 February 1965) was first a film director in Poland, then in Italy, and later( as Michael Waszynski) a producer of the major American films, mainly in Spain. Known for his elegance and impeccable manners, he was, by the people who knew him, known as\" the prince\". Waszyński was born as Mosze Waks into a Polish Jewish family as Michał Waks in 1904 in Kowel, a small town in Volhynia( now in Ukraine), which at the time was part of Imperial Russia. As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Michał Waszyński and converted to Catholicism. In the 1930s Waszyński became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish\" The Dybbuk\", today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust. At the beginning of World War II Waszyński escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Białystok. That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to the Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszyński began a new career as a theater director, first in Białystok and later in Moscow. In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszyński joined the newly formed Polish Army of general Władysław Anders( loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia( Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day. After World War II, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish- language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films. Later in his career, Waszyński worked as a producer for the major American studios in Italy and( primarily) Spain, credited as\" Michael Waszynski\". His credits include\" The Quiet American\"( 1958)( associate producer),\" El Cid\"( 1961), and\" The Fall of the Roman Empire( film)\"( 1964)( executive producer and associate producer). He died of a heart attack on 20 February 1965 in Madrid, and was buried in a ceremonious Catholic funeral in Rome. A Bay of Blood( Italian:\" Ecologia del delitto\", lit. \" Ecology of Crime\", later released as\" Reazione a catena\"[ lit.\" Chain Reaction\"]), also known as Carnage, Twitch of the Death Nerve and Blood Bath, is a 1971 Italian giallo film directed by Mario Bava. Bava co-wrote the screenplay with Giuseppe Zaccariello, Filippo Ottoni, and Sergio Canevari, with story credit given to Dardano Sacchetti and Franco Barberi. The film stars Claudine Auger, Luigi Pistilli and Laura Betti. Carlo Rambaldi created the gruesome special make- up effects. The story details a string of mysterious murders that occur around the titular bay. Widely considered Bava's most violent film, its emphasis on graphically bloody murder set pieces was hugely influential on the slasher film subgenre that would follow a decade later. In 2005, the magazine\" Total Film\" named\" A Bay of Blood\" one of the 50 greatest horror films of all time. Kocha, lubi, szanuje( English translation, Love, Cherish, Respect) is a 1934 Polish language romantic comedy film, produced in Poland by the European subsidiary of Universal Pictures and directed by Michał Waszyński."}]}

Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant. He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film\" Pallavi Anu Pallavi\". The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he was left with fewer offers. However, his fifth directorial outing,\" Mouna Ragam\"( 1986), established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema. He followed that with\" Nayakan\"( 1987). Mani Ratnam is well known for his\" Terrorism trilogy\" consisting of\" Roja\"( 1992),\" Bombay\"( 1995), and\" Dil Se..\"( 1998). He is married to actress Suhasini and has a son with her.

{"query": "What is the date of birth of Aaron The Tyrant's father?", "topk": [{"text": "Aaron the Tyrant  or Aron Vodă (\"Aron the Voivode\"), sometimes credited as Aron Emanoil or Emanuel Aaron (or \"Zalim\"; before 1560 – May 1597), was twice the Prince of Moldavia: between September 1591 and June 1592, and October 1592 to May 3 or 4, 1595. He was of mysterious origin, and possibly of Jewish extraction, but presented himself as the son of Alexandru Lăpușneanu, and was recognized as such in some circles. His appointment by the Ottoman Empire followed an informal race, during which candidates engaging in particularly exorbitant bribery and accepted unprecedented increases of the \"haraç\". Though resented by the Janissaries, he was backed by a powerful lobby, comprising Solomon Ashkenazi, Edward Barton, Hoca Sadeddin Efendi, and Patriarch Jeremias II. Victorious but heavily indebted, Aaron allowed his creditors to interfere directly in fiscal policy, while adopting methods of extortion against the taxpaying peasantry. He eventually turned against the bankers, staging the execution of Bartolomeo Brutti. Following such moves, and his heavy-handed repression of rebels in Lăpușna and Orhei, Aaron was ordered to step down by the Porte. The order was rescinded after two months, which had seen the ascendancy of a rebel Prince, Peter the Cossack. Aaron took back his throne, being increasingly reliant on support from the Principality of Transylvania. He entered his second reign as an obedient vassal of the Ottomans, while also turning against Moldavian Catholicism and expelling the Society of Jesus. In secret, he began negotiating Moldavia's participation in the anti-Ottoman \"Holy League\", defining himself as an ally of the Holy See and the Holy Roman Empire. This project drew support from Transylvania, which was then under Sigismund Báthory, as well as from Wallachia's Michael the Brave. With the start of the Long Turkish War in 1593, Moldavia became a secondary theater, invaded successively by the Crimean Khanate and the Zaporizhian Sich; after long negotiations, Aaron was able to ally himself with the latter. He then helped Michael of Wallachia attack the Ottoman flank, extending his rule into the Budjak and Northern Dobruja. During the events, he ordered a series of massacres, killing Ottoman Army prisoners and 19 Jewish financiers. Despite his military commitment and his quashing of a pro-Ottoman uprising, Aaron was viewed with suspicion by Báthory. Their relationship became tense after Aaron declined to swear fealty at the Transylvanian court, preferring instead for Moldavia to be ruled as a component of the Holy Roman Empire. Báthory reportedly undermined the League, depicting Aaron as untrustworthy; he also endorsed the Moldavian general Ștefan Răzvan, who arrested the Prince and took over his throne. Aaron and his family were exiled to Corona (Brașov), then detained at Martinuzzi Castle, Alvinc ( Vințu de Jos)—where Aaron died, allegedly poisoned. He was survived by his stepson Marcu Cercel, who attached himself to the Wallachian court and briefly served as Michael's subordinate Prince of Moldavia. Aaron's name is preserved by Aroneanu Church and eponymous village, both of which are located outside Iași. He is also celebrated as a sponsor of the First Romanian School in Șcheii Brașovului. Alexandru IV Lăpușneanu( 1499 – 5 May 1568) was Ruler of Moldavia between September 1552 and 18 November 1561 and then between October 1564 and 5 May 1568. His wife and consort was Doamna Rucsandra Lăpușneanu, the daughter of Peter IV Rareș and Princess Jelena Branković( the second daughter of Jovan Branković of Serbia). He was the original founder of the Dormition Church, Lviv, also commonly known as the Wallachian Church. His son Bogdan IV of Moldavia ruled 1568 – 1572."}]}

{"query": "What is the date of birth of Isabella Of Mar's husband?", "topk": [{"text": "Isabella of Mar( fl. c. 1277 – 12 December 1296) was the first wife of Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick. Isabella died before her husband was crowned( as Robert I) King of Scotland. She and her husband were the grandparents of Robert II, King of Scotland. Isabella was the daughter of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar( died 1297 × 1302) and Elena, daughter of Llywelyn the Great( died 1282). Isabella's father was evidently an adherent of Robert Bruce V, Lord of Annandale( died 1295), a man who staked a claim to the Scottish throne. The close relationship between the Domhnall's family and the Bruces is evidenced by two marriages. One was that between Isabella and Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick( died 1329), a grandson of Robert Bruce V. Domhnall's son and comital successor, Gartnait( died c.1302), married a sister of Robert Bruce VII. The marriage of Robert Bruce VII and Isabella probably took place in the 1290s. The union produced a single child, a daughter named Marjorie( died 1316), who was born in about 1296. Six years after Isabella's death, Robert Bruce VII married his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh( died 1327). Robert and Isabella's daughter, Marjorie, married Walter Stewart, Steward of Scotland, and their son eventually reigned as Robert II, King of Scotland( died 1390). Robert I (11 July 1274 – 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Medieval Gaelic: '; modern Scottish Gaelic: '; Norman French: ' or '; Early Scots: \"Robert Brus\"), was King of Scotland from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent country and is today revered in Scotland as a national hero. His paternal fourth great-grandfather was King David I. Robert's grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \"Great Cause\". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. Appointed in 1298 as a Guardian of Scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne, John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, Robert later resigned in 1300 due to his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of John Balliol to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to \"the king's peace\", Robert inherited his family's claim to the Scottish throne upon his father's death. In February 1306, Bruce, having wounded Comyn, rushed from the church where they had met and encountered his attendants outside. He told them what had happened and said, \"I must be off, for I doubt I have slain the Red Comyn. Doubt?\" , Roger de Kirkpatrick of Closeburn answered. \"I mak sikker,I'll make sure,\" or \"I make sure\"). Kirkpatrick then rushed into the church and killed Comyn. For this, Bruce was then excommunicated by the Pope (although he received absolution from Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne, and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, forcing him to flee into hiding before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Bruce defeated his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first parliament. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under Edward II of England, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert's armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern England, while also extending his war against the English to Ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the Irish to rise against Edward II's rule. Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland. Robert died in June 1329. His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey and his internal organs embalmed and placed in St Serf's Chapel, Dumbarton, site of the medieval Cardross Parish church."}]}

He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song \" He Stopped Loving Her Today\", as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last twenty years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song \" It's AlrightIf we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones. \" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum\". Born in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded \"White Lightning\", written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\". After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure. During his career, Jones had more than 150 hits, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists. Robert Christgau has called him \"honky-tonk's greatest honky\". \"Let's Build a World Together\" is a love song by George Jones and Tammy Wynette. It was the married couple's fourth single together on Epic Records and became the title track of their fourth LP in 1973. Although the song expressed the promise of new love, 1973 would be the beginning of the end as far as their marriage was concerned, with Wynette filing for divorce for the first time in August of that year. Their tumultuous personal life, which often made the gossip papers, coupled with their flawless vocal harmonies on love songs like \"Let's Build a World Together,\" mesmerized their fans. Indeed, the more their lives deteriorated, the bigger hits the couple would have, especially after their 1975 divorce. However, \"Let's Build a World Together\" was a very minor hit at best, only making it to #32 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart. Co-writer George Richey became Wynette's fifth husband."}]}

He was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but he spent most of his adult life in Mexico City, where he died. On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cortés married Puerto Rican childhood friend María del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cortés. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cortés played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La pícara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cortés returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cortés became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage.

From the age of fifteen, he was deeply interested in the theory of polytopes, which later became his main research interest. He was a distinguished graduate of the Gorny Institute, which he joined at the age of 26. He contributed to the identification of conditions under which a group of Euclidean motions must have a translational subgroup whose vectors span the Euclidean space. His best-known result is his 1891 derivation of the 230 symmetry space groups which now serve as the mathematical basis of structural analysis. He also proved that there are only 17 possible wallpaper groups which can tile a Euclidean plane. This was then proved independently by George Pólya in 1924. The proof that the list of wallpaper groups was complete only came after the much harder case of space groups had been settled. In 1895, he became a professor of geology at the Moscow Agricultural Institute (now the Timiryazev Academy). Fedorov died from pneumonia in 1919 during the Russian Civil War in Petrograd, RSFSR.

Born in Holland, Michigan, Bannister began acting in movies and on Broadway in the 1920s. He married the actress Ann Harding in 1926, and appeared with her in two films, \"Her Private Affair\" (1929) and \"The Girl of the Golden West\" (1930). The two of them also were prominent actors in Pittsburgh theatre, appearing in productions with the Sharp Company and later starting the Nixon Players. They were divorced in 1932. Bannister founded the American Music Hall Theatre Group in New York City. Its first production, a melodrama entitled \"The Drunkard\", ran for 277 performances. He appeared regularly on Broadway in the 1950s, starring, opposite Celeste Holm, in \"Affairs of State\" and in \"Love Me Long\" with Shirley Booth. On television Bannister played one of the fathers in the 1953 Russel Crouse TV series \"Life with Father\". He died in Manhattan, New York City, at the age of 71. Ann Harding (August 7, 1902 – September 1, 1981) was an American theatre, motion picture, radio, and television actress. A regular player on Broadway and in regional theater in the 1920s, in the 1930s Harding was one of the first actresses to gain fame in the new medium of \"talking pictures\", and she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1931 for her work in \"Holiday\". Harding was born Dorothy Walton Gatley, and was the daughter of a prominent United States Army officer. She was raised primarily in East Orange, New Jersey and graduated from East Orange High School. Having gained her initial acting experience in school drama classes, she decided on a career as an actress and moved to New York City. Because her father opposed her career choice, she used the stage name Ann Harding. After initial work as a script reader, Harding began to win roles on Broadway and in regional theaters, primarily in Pennsylvania. She moved to California to begin working in movies, which were just then beginning to include sound. Her work in plays had given her notable diction and stage presence, and she became a leading lady. By the late 1930s, she was becoming stereotyped as the beautiful, innocent, self-sacrificing woman, and film work became harder for her to obtain. After marrying conductor Werner Janssen in 1937, she worked only sporadically, with two notable roles coming in \"Eyes in the Night\" (1942) and \"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\" (1956). Harding also worked occasionally in television between 1955 and 1965, and she appeared in two plays in the early 1960s, returning to the stage after an absence of over 30 years, including the lead in \" The Corn is Green\" in 1964 at the Studio Theater in Buffalo, New York. After her 1965 retirement, she resided in Sherman Oaks, California. She died there in 1981, and was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park -- Hollywood Hills."}]}

{"query": "Who is the paternal grandfather of Philip Bertie?", "topk": [{"text": "Philip Bertie (c.1665 – 15 April 1728) was an English courtier and politician, the third son of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey. Bertie was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, from which he took a BA in 1685, and trained a company of volunteers of foot from among the Oxford scholars to support James II during the Monmouth Rebellion. During the Glorious Revolution, however, he joined his uncle, the Earl of Danby, in raising support for William of Orange in the North of England. By 1691, he had been appointed a Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber to Queen Mary, an office he held until her death in 1694. While he was passed over as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 1692 in favor of his elder brother Peregrine, he was appointed Auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall that year as a reward for his services. In 1693, he considered entering a by-election for Clitheroe in Lancashire, where his brother Lord Willoughby was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but ultimately declined, considering his interest there to be insufficient. The following year, on the advice of his uncle Peregrine, he stood for Stamford and was returned along with his uncle Charles. In the House of Commons, he seems to have followed his family in becoming part of the Tory faction of his uncle Danby (now Duke of Leeds). Bertie opposed the attainder of Sir John Fenwick in 1697; however, he escaped dismissal from his auditorship when other members of the family were put out of office that year. He declined to stand for Stamford in 1698, the Berties having agreed with the other county family, the Cecils, henceforth to share the seat; his uncle Charles continued as MP. He may have been the \"Bertie\" who contested Liskeard that year, but stood fourth in the poll. In 1699, he was successfully sued in the Court of King's Bench by Sir Philips Coote for having an affair with Coote's wife, Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of William Brabazon, 3rd Earl of Meath. He unsuccessfully contested Mitchell in December 1701, on the strength of his auditorship. In 1704, he was replaced as auditor by his brother Albemarle, a Whig. Bertie's salary as a Gentleman Usher had been converted to a pension upon the death of Queen Mary, but he found it increasingly difficult to collect under the Whig administration, and was forced to appeal to Lord Oxford, the Treasurer, for assistance. During the same year, Bertie unsuccessfully contested a by-election at Boston to succeed his brother Peregrine. While his appeal on petition to the elections committee of the House of Commons was upheld, the House held that the interference of his eldest brother, the Earl of Lindsey and Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, had voided the election, and he again lost the subsequent by-election.

It comes after\" First Snow\" and before\" Sad Pastorale\" in Kim's trilogy of films about human survival during wartime. Kim Ki-young ( October 10, 1919 – February 5, 1998) was a South Korean film director, known for his intensely psychosexual and melodramatic horror films, often focusing on the psychology of their female characters. Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s.

{"query": "Where was the father of Beatrice Of England born?", "topk": [{"text": "Henry III (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard Marshal, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard of Cornwall in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund Crouchback on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. In 1263, one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death; however, he was not canonised. Beatrice of England( 25 June 1242 – 24 March 1275) was a member of the House of Plantagenet, the daughter of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence."}]}

The group came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward, and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's \"classic era\" into the early 1970s. Their second album, \"Days of Future Passed\", which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\". The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound and produced \"The Other Side of Life\" in 1986, which made them the first act to earn each of its first three top 10 singles in the United States in a different decade. Health troubles led to a diminished role for founder Ray Thomas throughout the 1980s, though his musical contributions rebounded after Moraz departed in 1991. Thomas retired from the band in 2002. The band's most recent album was \"December\" (2003), a collection of Christmas music. They continued to tour throughout the first decade of the 2000s, and they still regroup for periodic events, one-off concerts, short tours, and cruises. The Moody Blues' most successful singles include \"Go NowNights in White SatinTuesday AfternoonQuestion\", and \"Your Wildest Dreams\". The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide, which includes 18 platinum and gold LPs. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. \"Higher and Higher\" is the opening track of the Moody Blues 1969 album \"To Our Children's Children's Children\", a concept album about space travel. The verses of the song are spoken by Mike Pinder, rather than sung. Sound effects of a rocket launching begin the song and last for the first minute. \"Higher and Higher\" was also the Moody Blues' first full length song that was written by the band's drummer Graeme Edge. Edge was usually the writer of short spoken-word interludes that appeared at the beginning and end of previous albums. In the recordings, they were usually recited by Mike Pinder. The Moody Blues continue to perform \"Higher and Higher\" live in concert. Graeme Edge now provides the lead spoken verses in concert since Mike Pinder is no longer with the band. Since this requires Edge to take center stage to recite the verse, the drums are performed by their back-up drummer Gordon Marshall. At the end of the verses, Edge then returns to the drum set and concludes the song on the drums. The album was one of those listened to, on cassette tape, by the crew of Apollo 15 in 1971."}]}

{"query": "Where was the performer of song Kiss Me Quick (Elvis Presley Song) born?", "topk": [{"text": "\"Kiss Me Quick\" is a 1961 song recorded by Elvis Presley which was first released on the album \"Pot Luck with Elvis\". It was released as a single in the UK in 1963 and the U.S. in 1964. Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame."}]}

Edwards began his career in the 1940s as an actor, but he soon began writing screenplays and radio scripts before turning to producing and directing in television and films. His best- known films include\" Breakfast at Tiffany' s Days of Wine and Roses10Victor/ Victoria\", and the hugely successful Pink Panther film series with British actor Peter Sellers. Often thought of as primarily a director of comedies, he also directed several drama, musical, and detective films. Late in his career, he transitioned to writing, producing, and directing for theater. In 2004, he received an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of his writing, directing, and producing an extraordinary body of work for the screen. A Shot in the Dark is a 1964 British-American DeLuxe Color comedy film directed by Blake Edwards in Panavision. It is the second installment in \"The Pink Panther\" film series, with Peter Sellers reprising his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the French Sûreté. Clouseau's blundering personality is unchanged, but it was in this film that Sellers began to give him the idiosyncratically exaggerated French accent that was to later become a hallmark of the character. The film also marks the first appearances of Herbert Lom as his long-suffering boss, Commissioner Dreyfus, as well as Burt Kwouk as his stalwart man servant Cato and André Maranne as François, all three of whom would become series regulars. Elke Sommer portrays the murder suspect, Maria Gambrelli. The character of Gambrelli would return in \"Son of the Pink Panther\" (1993), this time played by Claudia Cardinale, who appeared as Princess Dala in \"The Pink Panther\" (1963). Graham Stark, who portrays police officer Hercule Lajoy, would reprise this role eighteen years later, in \"Trail of the Pink Panther\" (1982). The film was not originally written to include Clouseau, but was an adaptation of a stage play by Harry Kurnitz adapted from a French play \"L'Idiote\" by Marcel Achard. The film was released only a few months after the first Clouseau film, \"The Pink Panther\". Harmony Korine( born January 4, 1973) is an American film director and screenwriter.

His film\" Trash Humpers\"( 2009) premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and won the main prize, the DOX Award, at the CPH: DOX. In 2019, Korine directed his first project in six years,\" The Beach Bum\". Spring Breakers is a 2012 American crime film written and directed by Harmony Korine. It stars James Franco, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens and Rachel Korine and follows four college- aged girls on their spring break in Florida where they meet an eccentric local drug dealer named Alien who helps them in a time of desperation, and their eventual descent into a world of drugs, crime, and violence. Korine had devised the concept for\" Spring Breakers\" over several years prior to production, with fleeting ideas about the plot and what should transpire. His initial desire was to create a\" sensory film\" that was more about feeling than action and placed little importance on narrative or plot, the idea for which came later. Once Korine developed the backbone of the story, which takes place around the American spring break period, he travelled to Florida to write the screenplay. Production began in 2012, on an estimated budget of$ 5 million, making it Korine's second most expensive film to date. The film is also one of Korine's first theatrical works to receive a wide release. \" Spring Breakers\" was released on March 22, 2013 in the United States by A24 and grossed$ 31 million worldwide, making it a resounding success considering the small budget. It received generally positive reviews from film critics, with some calling it a potential cult classic. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Critics and scholars have read deeper meaning in the film's plot, commenting on its reflection of modern- day superficiality and the younger generation's self- destructive obsession with highly stylised, disposable pop culture media and sensory ephemera. It ranks in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century. A sequel, under the name of\" Spring Breakers: The Second Coming\", was announced in 2014 for an undated release. Jonas Åkerlund was attached to direct with Irvine Welsh penning the script, without the involvement of Korine or the original cast."}]}

She was the second wife and widow of longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was 22 years her senior. Edward Moore Kennedy (February 22, 1932 – August 25, 2009) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts for almost 47 years, from 1962 until his death in 2009. A member of the Democratic Party and the Kennedy political family, he was the second most senior member of the Senate when he died and is the third-longest-continuously-serving senator in United States history. Kennedy was a brother of President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy—both victims of assassination—and was the father of Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy. After attending Harvard University and receiving his law degree from the University of Virginia, he began his career as an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Kennedy was 30 years old when he first entered the Senate following a November 1962 special election in Massachusetts to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother John, who had taken office as the president. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, as well as physical injuries and mental anguish to Kennedy. He pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming president. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. Kennedy was known for his oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his 1980 rallying cry for modern American liberalism were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as \"The Lion of the Senate\" through his long tenure and influence. Kennedy and his staff wrote more than 300 bills that were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government that emphasized economic and social justice, but he was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the National Cancer Act of 1971, the COBRA health insurance provision, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Ryan White AIDS Care Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Mental Health Parity Act, the S-CHIP children's health program, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful immigration reform efforts. Over the course of his Senate career, Kennedy made efforts to enact universal health care, which he called the \"cause of my life. \" By the later years of his life, Kennedy had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism. Kennedy died on August 25, 2009 of a malignant brain tumor at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and was buried near his brothers John and Robert at Arlington National Cemetery."}]}

San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom signed a proclamation declaring February 23, 2007 as \"Colt Studio Day\" in celebration of this anniversary. This proclamation attracted criticism from conservative commentators including then–Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly. Colt was discussed in a 2014 article in the academic journal \"Fashion Theory\" by Shaun Cole, who argued that the characters in the company's pornography are \"constructed through their clothing and costuming\", and noted that it was famed for its \"presentation of hypermasculine\nimages\". He also observed that the choice of the name \"Colt\" by the company's founders, Jim French and Lou Thomas, reflected a \"gun theme\"; a previous company founded by French had been called \"Lüger\", after the German pistol. According to Cole, French's use of the pseudonym \"Rip Colt\" was \"inspired by an amateur photographer in San Francisco\" named Rip Searby.

{"query": "Which film has the director born later, Help Wanted (1915 Film) or La Belle Noiseuse?", "topk": [{"text": "Jacques Rivette (1 March 1928 – 29 January 2016) was a French film director and film critic most commonly associated with the French New Wave and the film magazine \"Cahiers du Cinéma\". He made twenty-nine films, including \"L'amour fou\" (1969), \"Out 1\" (1971), \"Celine and Julie Go Boating\" (1974), and \"La Belle Noiseuse\" (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois' Cinémathèque Française and other ciné-clubs; there, he met François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by André Bazin for \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films – especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray – and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette's articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine's best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article \"On Abjection\" and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including \"Le Coup de Berger\", which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement. Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, \"Paris Belongs to Us\" was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, \"The Nun\" (1966). He then re-evaluated his career, developing a unique cinematic style with \"L'amour fou\". Influenced by the political turmoil of May 68, improvisational theatre and an in-depth interview with filmmaker Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour \"Out 1\" which, although rarely screened, is considered a Holy Grail of cinephiles. His films of the 1970s, such as \"Celine and Julie Go Boating\", often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years. During the early 1980s, he began a business partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, and his film \"La Belle Noiseuse\" received international praise. He retired after completing \"Around a Small Mountain\" (2009), and it was revealed three years later that he had Alzheimer's disease. Very private about his personal life, Rivette was briefly married to photographer and screenwriter Marilù Parolini during the early 1960s and later married Véronique Manniez. La Belle Noiseuse is a 1991 drama film directed by Jacques Rivette and starring Michel Piccoli, Jane Birkin, and Emmanuelle Béart. It s title means\" The Beautiful( female) Troublemaker\". The film is loosely adapted from the short story\" The Unknown Masterpiece\" by Honoré de Balzac and also includes elements from\" The Liar The Figure in the Carpet\", and\" The Aspern Papers\" by Henry James.
