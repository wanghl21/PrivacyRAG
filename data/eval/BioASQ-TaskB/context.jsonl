Prospective DPYD genotyping was feasible in routine clinical practice, and DPYD genotype-based dose reductions improved patient safety of fluoropyrimidine treatment.Colorectal cancer (CCR), which is one of the most common causes of cancer, has benefited from the major advances in the understanding of the intracellular signaling pathways implicated in the initiation, growing and local and metastasis dissemination of tumor, which have occurred during the 20 past years. The pharmacogenomics approach, especially the determination of the genetic polymorphisms, tries to find prognosis and predictive biomarkers permitting to identify patients who could benefit from a particular treatment or those exhibiting higher risks of toxicity. Among the numerous biomarkers, which have been studied, few are currently in use in clinical practice. The phenotyping of DPD and UGT1A1 activities, and to a lesser extent, its genotyping, appears as the most useful tool in terms of prediction of toxicities induced by two major drugs: 5-FU and irinotecan. For oxaliplatin, the determination of the polymorphisms of reparases and detoxification systems such as GSTpi seems interesting, but itsforms the basis for the chemotherapy of advanced colorectal cancer and of other solid tumours. About 9% of patients suffer from serious, sometimes even life-threatening adverse effects of a 5-FU therapy, such as haemotoxicity, which cannot be reliably predicted by conventional clinical and pharmacokinetic criteria. The systemic exposure to 5-FU is fundamentally determined by the genetically polymorphic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). This deficiency is closely related to 5-FU-induced toxicity and a variety of non-synonymous variants has been detected in affected patients. The exon14-skipping mutation is the gene defect most frequently associated with serious 5-FU-related adverse effects and it has been reported ten times more often in affected individuals than in the general population. The 2846A>T polymorphism, which leads to an amino acid substitution, appears to be of comparable importance. While the causative role of premature stop codons - presumably resulting from spontaneous mutations - is very likely, the pathophysiological relevance of various other amino acid changes is still unclear. Patients who harbour a high-risk genotype should not be treated with 5-FU if therapeutic alternatives are available. The present data indicate that complete genotyping of the encoding DPYD gene is desirable, in the interest of drug safety, before treatment is started, although only a small number of patients would actually benefit. A method for the quantification of the DPD activity in vivo would have the advantage of reflecting all genetic and non-genetic influences.'

An altered Rb expression or p53 overexpression is thought to indicate defective tumor suppression and subsequently more aggressive tumors.The etiology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most serious form of brain cancer, remains obscure, although it has been proposed that cancer risk is a function of random polymerase errors that occur during stem cell division and the resulting mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Analysis of the 8 genes (PTEN, TP53, EGFR, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, NF1, RB1, IDH1) that are mutated in at least 5% of GBM tumors indicates a non-random mutation pattern that reflects a significant role for hydrolytic deamination at CpG sites."}]}

Cholesterol or oxysterols ingested as food are absorbed and packed into lipoproteins that are taken up by hepatic cells. Within hepatic cells, excess cholesterol is metabolised to form bile acids. The endoplasmic reticulum acts as the main organelle in the bile acid synthesis pathway. Metabolised sterols originating from this pathway are distributed within other organelles and in the cell membrane. The alterations to membrane oxysterol:sterol ratio affects the integrity of the cell membrane. The presence of oxysterols changes membrane fluidity and receptor orientation.Oxidation of cholesterol leads to the formation of a large number of oxidized products, generally known as oxysterols. They are intermediates in the biosynthesis of bile acids, steroid hormones, and 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3. Although oxysterols are considered as metabolic intermediates, there is a growing body of evidence that many of them are bioactive, and their absence or excess may be part of the cause of a disease phenotype."}]}

Although many clinical trials aiming to study EGFR targeted therapies have been performed, none of them have reported promising clinical results when used in glioma patients.It is known that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification is a characteristic of the classical subtype of glioma. However, targeted therapies against this type of receptor have not yet shown a clear clinical benefit.We tested this assumption by a multilevel analysis ranging from a detailed histopathological analysis to a genome-wide expression profiling by microarray and RNA-seq on gliomas induced by two distinct molecular alterations: the overstimulation of the PDGF- and the EGF- pathways. These alterations are landmarks of proneural and classical glioblastoma subtypes respectively. However, our results consistently showed a strong similarity between the two glioma models.EGFR amplification and classical subtype are associated with a poor response to bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma.FHL1 is highly expressed and positively correlated with EGFR levels in human GBM, particularly those of the classical subtype."}]}

{"query": "Is DNA methylation always associated with gene silencing?", "topk": [{"text": "DNA methylation is most commonly associated with downregulation of gene expression. However, positive associations of DNA methylation to gene expression have also been reported, suggesting a more diverse mechanism of epigenetic regulation.DNA methylation is frequently described as a 'silencing' epigenetic mark, and indeed this function of 5-methylcytosine was originally proposed in the 1970s. Now, thanks to improved genome-scale mapping of methylation, we can evaluate DNA methylation in different genomic contexts: transcriptional start sites with or without CpG islands, in gene bodies, at regulatory elements and at repeat sequences. The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. Improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. In the standard model, methylation in gene promoters has received the most attention since it is generally associated with transcriptional silencing. Nevertheless, recent studies in human tissues reveal that methylation of the region downstream of the transcription start site is highly informative of gene expression. Also, in some cell types and specific genes it has been found that methylation of the first intron, a gene feature typically rich in enhancers, is linked with gene expression. Classically, dense promoter DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional repression. However, growing evidence suggests that this association may not always hold true, and promoter hypermethylation now also appears to be associated with high transcriptional activity. Furthermore, in a selection of contexts, increasing levels of promoter methylation correlate directly with increased gene expression."}]}

{"query": "Which dietary compounds are associated with colorectal cancer incidence?", "topk": [{"text": "This umbrella review found convincing evidence of an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat.high red meat intake was positively associated with risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and high processed meat intake was positively associated with risk of breast, colorectal, colon, rectal, and lung cancers.Higher risk of colorectal, colon, rectal, lung, and renal cell cancers were also observed with high total red and processed meat consumption.Epidemiological studies have shown that a high fat (or meat) intake is associated positively and a high starch, fibre (non-starch polysaccharide), vegetable and fruit intake negatively with colorectal cancer incidence.Consumption of high amounts of red and processed meat and low intake of fiber and multiple protective phytochemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains might be responsible for the high incidence of this neoplasm in the Western world.Although the etiology of colorectal cancer is multifactorial, experimental evidence suggests a role for dietary factors in the promotion of this disease. The complex interrelations governing energy balance and the consumption of fat, fiber, and micronutrients make it difficult to define the precise role of specific dietary factors in the etiology of colorectal neoplasms. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a correlation between the prevalence of colorectal cancer and per capita consumption of meat and fat. Case-control studies investigating the relation between colorectal cancer and dietary fat consumption have yielded inconsistent results. Prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a relation between fat consumption and subsequent risk for colorectal cancer. There is an inverse correlation between fiber intake and the prevalence of colorectal carcinoma. A more detailed analysis of the influence of various types of dietary fiber on the subsequent risk for colorectal cancer will provide a better understanding of this relation. Fiber derived from fruits and vegetables may provide more effective protection than cereal fibers. Correlational studies have established an association between total caloric intake and the prevalence of colorectal carcinoma. The design of future studies investigating the influence of individual dietary constituents on the risk for colorectal cancer must control for variations in energy balance as a confounding variable. Recent evidence suggests that a variety of micronutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, selenium, and vitamins A, C, and E, exert an anticarcinogenic effect. Studies designed to evaluate the influence of alcohol consumption on colorectal carcinogenesis have yielded inconclusive results. The potential influence of food preparation methods on colorectal carcinogenesis requires further evaluation. There is no conclusive evidence to support any of the hypotheses proposed to explain the role of dietary factors in colorectal carcinogenesis. Intervention trials designed to monitor intermediate markers for colorectal cancer such as increased epithelial-cell proliferation rates and the development of aberrant crypt architecture provide the opportunity for testing these hypotheses in relatively short-term studies. The results from such studies can be utilized in the design of large-scale, long-term prospective studies to evaluate the influence of dietary factors on the development of colorectal neoplasms. These trials should generate the information required to develop strategies for diet modification to reduce the incidence of colorectal carcinoma."}]}

In patients with OCD, however, a high-dose of serotonin-reuptake inhibitor monotherapy may not be sufficient, and approximately half of patients were noted to be treatment-resistant. As results from previous studies have shown, there have been positive treatment responses to the dopaminergic antagonists.

Melanoma cells can switch between a melanocytic and a mesenchymal-like state.Taken together, these analyses indicate that an intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct and stable 'mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic heterogeneous mix of cells.Melanoma exhibits numerous transcriptional cell states including neural crest-like cells as well as pigmented melanocytic cells.Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state.Robust gene expression programs underlie recurrent cell states and phenotype switching in melanoma.Melanoma cells display distinct intrinsic phenotypic states.In melanoma, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy, making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant.Melanomas can have multiple coexisting cell states, including proliferative (PRO) versus invasive (INV) subpopulations that represent a \"go or grow\" trade-off; however, how these populations interact is poorly understood."}]}

By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with mass spectrometry, we investigated cis-regulatory regions in macrophages to comprehensively identify histone marks specifically associated with enhancers, and to profile their dynamics after transcriptional activation elicited by an inflammatory stimulation. The intersection of the proteomics data with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed the existence of novel subpopulations of enhancers, marked by specific histone modification signatures: specifically, H3K4me1/K36me2 marks transcribed enhancers, while H3K4me1/K36me3 and H3K4me1/K79me2 combinations mark distinct classes of intronic enhancers."}]}

Over and above these common features, they differ in the presence or absence of various organ and tissue abnormalities, and differences in genetic causal mechanisms and degree of severity. They are complex and multisystem diseases, with the majority being highly disabling because of major joint problems and neurosensory deficiencies, and in some cases, they may be life-threatening due to associated complications, especially vascular disorders. In 1997, the Villefranche classification defined 6 subtypes of EDS. However, many other new variants have been described over the last years.
