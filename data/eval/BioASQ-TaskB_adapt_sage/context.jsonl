Interestingly, **V600E status did not significantly affect progression-free survival (PFS) or objective response rates (ORR)** to therapy.  \n\nThese findings underscore the critical prognostic role of **BRAF V600E** in CRC, highlighting its association with aggressive disease biology and poor survival, particularly in MSS tumors, while emphasizing the need for tailored therapeutic strategies."}]}
{"query": "Which genetic alteration is most commonly associated with the classical subtype of glioblastoma?", "topk": [{"text": "Glioblastoma (GBM), particularly the classical subtype, remains a highly aggressive and incurable malignancy despite advances in molecular understanding. A key hallmark of classical GBM is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification; however, targeted therapies against EGFR have shown limited clinical efficacy, with no significant improvement in patient outcomes. Intriguingly, genomic analyses comparing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- and EGF-driven glioma models revealed unexpected similarities between these subtypes, challenging conventional distinctions. Furthermore, classical GBM with EGFR amplification correlates with poor response to bevacizumab, a standard treatment for recurrent cases. Additionally, four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 1 (FHL1) exhibits high expression in classical GBM and is positively associated with EGFR levels, suggesting a potential role in tumor biology. These findings underscore the persistent challenges in treating classical GBM and highlight the need for novel therapeutic strategies beyond EGFR inhibition."}]}

{"query": "Has statin use been associated with a higher risk of dementia?", "topk": [{"text": "The impact of statin use on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia remains a topic of significant debate, with conflicting evidence on its potential benefits or risks. While some studies suggest a protective effect of statin therapy against dementia, others find no significant association. Key findings indicate that statins may reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (relative risk [RR] 0.69) and vascular dementia (RR 0.93), particularly with longer duration of use and higher potency. Factors such as patient demographics, including gender differences, and adherence to statin therapy further influence outcomes. For instance, prolonged statin use has been associated with a significant trend of reduced dementia risk (P = 0.002), as highlighted in a Taiwan study. Additionally, statin intensity and adherence appear to enhance protective effects, especially in specific populations like patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, conflicting results persist, with some research showing no clear neurocognitive risk or benefit. Overall, the relationship between statin therapy and dementia risk is complex, warranting further investigation to clarify its role in cognitive health."}]}
{"query": "Is DNA methylation always associated with gene silencing?", "topk": [{"text": "DNA methylation, once primarily regarded as a gene silencing mechanism, is now recognized for its nuanced and context-dependent role in regulating gene expression. Initially proposed in the 1970s as a repressive mark, advances in genome-scale mapping have revealed its diverse regulatory functions across different genomic contexts, including gene promoters, transcriptional start sites, gene bodies, and regulatory elements. While promoter methylation has traditionally been associated with transcriptional repression, emerging evidence demonstrates its potential to correlate with increased gene expression in specific scenarios. Additionally, methylation patterns downstream of transcription start sites and within the first intron have been identified as informative markers of gene activity. This evolving understanding of DNA methylation\u2019s multifaceted roles challenges the simplistic view of it as a purely repressive mechanism and underscores its complexity in gene regulation. Furthermore, deciphering these context-dependent functions is critical for interpreting the role of DNA methylation in diseases such as cancer, where aberrant methylation patterns are frequently observed. This synthesis of recent findings highlights the need for a more comprehensive framework to elucidate the intricate regulatory landscape of DNA methylation in gene expression."}]}

{"query": "Is FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept a cost-effective treatment in patients with advanced colorectal caner?", "topk": [{"text": "This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of adding aflibercept (AFL) or ramucirumab (RAM) to FOLFIRI as a second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) compared to FOLFIRI alone. Both AFL and RAM in combination with FOLFIRI demonstrate improved overall survival and progression-free survival in mCRC patients. However, these therapeutic combinations are not cost-effective in either the UK or Japanese healthcare systems due to substantial additional costs. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance (TA307) does not recommend AFL with FOLFIRI for mCRC resistant to oxaliplatin-based regimens, citing cost-effectiveness concerns. Similarly, a partitioned survival analysis in Japan, utilizing data from the VELOUR and RAISE trials, found that the incremental cost of AFL or RAM exceeds the willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a57.5 million per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Additionally, AFL combined with FOLFIRI is associated with worse safety profiles compared to FOLFIRI alone. Sensitivity analyses, incorporating a 2% annual discount on costs and QALYs, confirmed the robustness of these findings. Despite their clinical efficacy, the high costs of AFL and RAM make these treatments economically unviable in both healthcare systems, underscoring the need for more cost-effective therapeutic strategies in mCRC management."}]}

The globus pallidus internus (GPi) is a primary target for DBS in PD and other movement disorders, while reductions in brain volume in regions such as the nucleus accumbens, GP, and habenula have been linked to opioid addiction. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been employed to assess magnetic susceptibility in basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus. In PSP, tau pathology and iron accumulation in the GP and substantia nigra (SN) are hallmark features, with similar mechanisms implicated in aging. The clinical effects of DBS, such as its efficacy in Tourette\u2019s disorder (TD) and its impact on weight changes, remain under investigation. A pilot study involving 4 PD patients explored cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes following GPi-DBS, while a cross-sectional analysis included 99 normal individuals and 39 patients with delayed development.
